person1 person1   but do pron1 really think a man be chin can be too square   pron1 think a man should look very very strong and that pron1 chin should be quite quite square 

person1   person1   then pron1 should certainly know person1 person1 person1   pron1 be only fair to tell pron1 beforehand pron1 have get no conversation at all 

person1 person1   pron1 adore silent man 

person1   person1   oh ernest be not silent   pron1 talk the whole time   but pron1 have get no conversation   pron1 pron1 talk about pron1 do not know   pron1 have not listen to pron1 for year 

person1 person1   have pron1 never forgive pron1 then   how sad that seem   but all life be very very sad be pron1 not 

person1   person1   person1 lady person1 be simply a person1 person1 person1 person1 make up of exquisite moment 

person1 person1   yes pron1 be moment certainly   but be pron1 pron1 very very wrong that person1   person1 do   do pron1 become angry with pron1 and say pron1 pron1 be unkind or true 

person1   person1   oh dear no   person1 be invariably calm   that be ordinal1 of the reason pron1 always get on pron1 nerve   pron1 be so aggravating as calmness   pron1 be pron1 positively brutal about the good temper of most modern man   pron1 wonder pron1 woman stand pron1 as well as pron1 do 

person1 person1   yes   man be good temper show pron1 be not so sensitive as pron1 be not so finely string   pron1 make a great barrier often between husband and wife do pron1 not   but pron1 would so much like to know pron1 be the wrong thing person1   person1 do 

person1   person1   well pron1 will tell pron1 if pron1 solemnly promise to tell pron1 else 

person1 person1   thank pron1 thank pron1   pron1 will make a point of repeat pron1 

person1   person1   when ernest and pron1 be engage pron1 swear to pron1 positively on pron1 knee that pron1 have never love any one before in the whole course of pron1 life   pron1 be very young at the time so pron1 do not believe pron1 pron1 need not tell pron1   unfortunately however pron1 make no enquiry of any kind till after pron1 have be actually marry ordinal1 or ordinal1 month   pron1 find out then that pron1 pron1 have tell pron1 be perfectly true   and that sort of thing make a man so absolutely uninteresting 

person1 person1   pron1 dear 

person1   person1   man always want to be a woman be first love   that be pron1 clumsy vanity   pron1 woman have a more subtle instinct about thing   pron1 pron1 like be to be a man be last romance 

person1 person1   pron1 see pron1 pron1 mean   pron1 be very very beautiful 

person1 person1   pron1 dear child pron1 do not mean to tell pron1 that pron1 will not forgive pron1 husband because pron1 never love any one else   do pron1 ever hear such a thing caroline   pron1 be quite surprised 

person1 caroline   oh woman have become so highly educate person1 that pron1 should surprise pron1 nowadays except happy marriage   pron1 apparently be get remarkably rare 

person1   person1   oh pron1 be quite out of date 

person1 person1   except amongst the middle class pron1 have be tell 

person1   person1   how like the middle class 

person1 person1   yes be pron1 not   very very like pron1 

person1 caroline   if pron1 pron1 tell pron1 about the middle class be true lady person1 pron1 redound greatly to pron1 credit   pron1 be much to be regret that in pron1 rank of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous under the impression apparently that pron1 be the proper thing to be   pron1 be to that pron1 attribute the unhappiness of so many marriage pron1 all know of in society 

person1   person1   do pron1 know person1 person1 pron1 do not think the frivolity of the wife have ever pron1 to do with pron1   more marriage be ruin nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by pron1 else   how can a woman be expect to be happy with a man pron1 insist on treat pron1 as if pron1 be a perfectly rational being 

person1 person1   pron1 dear 

person1   person1   man poor awkward reliable necessary man belong to a sex pron1 have be rational for million and million of year   pron1 can not help pron1   pron1 be in pron1 race   the history of woman be very different   pron1 have always be picturesque protest against the mere existence of common sense   pron1 see pron1 danger from the first 

person1 person1   yes the common sense of husband be certainly most most try   do tell pron1 pron1 conception of the ideal husband   pron1 think pron1 would be so very very helpful 

person1   person1   the ideal husband   pron1 could not be such a thing   the institution be wrong 

person1 person1   the ideal man then in pron1 relation to pron1 

person1 caroline   pron1 would probably be extremely realistic 

person1   person1   the ideal man   oh the ideal man should talk to pron1 as if pron1 be goddess and treat pron1 as if pron1 be child   pron1 should refuse all pron1 serious request and gratify every ordinal1 of pron1 whim   pron1 should encourage pron1 to have caprice and forbid pron1 to have mission   pron1 should always say much more than pron1 mean and always mean much more than pron1 say 

person1 person1   but how could pron1 do both dear 

person1   person1   pron1 should never run down other pretty woman   that would show pron1 have no taste or make ordinal1 suspect that pron1 have too much   no   pron1 should be nice about pron1 all but say that somehow pron1 do not attract pron1 

person1 person1   yes that be always very very pleasant to hear about other woman 

person1   person1   if pron1 ask pron1 a question about pron1 pron1 should give pron1 an answer all about pron1   pron1 should invariably praise pron1 for whatever quality pron1 know pron1 have not get   but pron1 should be pitiless quite pitiless in reproach pron1 for the virtue pron1 pron1 have never dream of possess   pron1 should never believe that pron1 know the use of useful thing   that would be unforgiveable   but pron1 should shower on pron1 pron1 pron1 do not want 

person1 person1   as far as pron1 can see pron1 be to do pron1 but pay bill and compliment 

person1   person1   pron1 should persistently compromise pron1 in public and treat pron1 with absolute respect when pron1 be alone   and yet pron1 should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene whenever pron1 want ordinal1 and to become miserable absolutely miserable at a moment be notice and to overwhelm pron1 with just reproach in less than ordinal1 minute and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour and to leave pron1 for ever at a quarter to ordinal1 when pron1 have to go and dress for dinner   and when after that pron1 have see pron1 for really the last time and pron1 have refuse to take back the little thing pron1 have give ordinal1 and promise never to communicate with ordinal1 again or to write ordinal1 any foolish letter pron1 should be perfectly break hearted and telegraph to ordinal1 all day long and send ordinal1 little note every half hour by a private hansom and dine quite alone at the club so that every one should know how unhappy pron1 be   and after a whole dreadful week during which pron1 have go about everywhere with ordinal1 be husband just to show how absolutely lonely ordinal1 be pron1 may be give a third last parting in the evening and then if pron1 conduct have be quite irreproachable and pron1 have behave really badly to pron1 pron1 should be allow to admit that pron1 have be entirely in the wrong and when pron1 have admit that pron1 become a woman be duty to forgive and pron1 can do pron1 all over again from the beginning with variation 

person1 person1   how clever pron1 be pron1 dear   pron1 never mean a single word pron1 say 

person1 person1   thank pron1 thank pron1   pron1 have be quite quite entrance   pron1 must try and remember pron1 all   pron1 be such a number of detail pron1 be so very very important 

person1 caroline   but pron1 have not tell pron1 yet pron1 the reward of the ideal man be to be 

person1   person1   pron1 reward   oh infinite expectation   that be quite enough for pron1 

person1 person1   but man be so terribly terribly exact be pron1 not 

person1   person1   that make no matter   pron1 should never surrender 

person1 person1   not even to the ideal man 

person1   person1   certainly not to pron1   unless of course pron1 want to grow tired of pron1 

person1 person1   oh            yes   pron1 see that   pron1 be very very helpful   do pron1 think person1   person1 pron1 shall ever meet the ideal man   or be pron1 more than ordinal1

person1   oh no   pron1 mother have be so good to pron1   no one ever have such a mother as pron1 have have 

person1 person1   pron1 be quite sure of that   still pron1 should imagine that most mother do not quite understand pron1 son   do not realise pron1 mean that a son have ambition a desire to see life to make pron1 a name   after all person1 pron1 could not be expect to pass all pron1 life in such a hole as wrockley could pron1 

person1   oh no   pron1 would be dreadful 

person1 person1   a mother be love be very touching of course but pron1 be often curiously selfish   pron1 mean pron1 be a good deal of selfishness in pron1 

person1   slowly   pron1 suppose pron1 be 

person1 person1   pron1 mother be a thoroughly good woman   but good woman have such limited view of life pron1 horizon be so small pron1 interest be so petty be not pron1

person1   pron1 should like to wear nice thing awfully but pron1 have always be tell that a man should not think too much about pron1 clothe 

person1 person1   people nowadays be so absolutely superficial that pron1 do not understand the philosophy of the superficial   by the way person1 pron1 should learn how to tie pron1 tie well   sentiment be all very well for the button hole   but the essential thing for a necktie be style   a well tie tie be the first serious step in life 

person1   laugh   pron1 might be able to learn how to tie a tie person1 person1 but pron1 should never be able to talk as pron1 do   pron1 do not know how to talk
