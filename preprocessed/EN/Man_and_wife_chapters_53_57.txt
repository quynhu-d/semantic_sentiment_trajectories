hour after hour pron1 doggedly plod through ordinal1 case of murder after 
another   pron1 have read ordinal1 good half of the horrid chronicle of crime 
before pron1 power of fix pron1 attention begin to fail pron1   then pron1 
lit pron1 pipe and go out to think over pron1 in the garden   however the 
atrocity of which pron1 have be read might differ in other 
respect pron1 be ordinal1 terrible point of resemblance which pron1 have 
not anticipate and in which every ordinal1 of the case agree   person1 
or later pron1 be the dead body always certain to be find   always 
bear pron1 dumb witness in the trace of poison or in the mark of 
violence to the crime commit on pron1 

pron1 walk to and fro slowly still ponder over the problem which 
have first find pron1 way into pron1 mind when pron1 have stop in the front 
person1 and have look up at person1 be window in the dark   how   that have 
be the ordinal1 question before pron1 from the time when the lawyer have

to pron1 

never   pron1 would go back to the book   pron1 be not at the end of pron1   the 
slight hint in the page which be still to be read might set pron1 
sluggish brain work in the right direction   the way to be rid of pron1 
without exciting the suspicion of any live creature in the house or 
out of pron1 be a way pron1 might be find yet 



could a man in pron1 position of life reason in this brutal manner

  as person1 person1 once put pron1 pron1 swiftness in run pron1 admirable 
capacity and endurance in other physical exercise help pron1 to win a 
purely moral victory over pron1 own selfishness and pron1 own cruelty   no

public feeling about pron1 have tacitly encourage have leave pron1 at the 
mercy of the bad instinct in pron1 nature of all pron1 be most vile 
and of all pron1 be most dangerous in the composition of the natural 
man   with the mass of pron1 fellow no harm out of the common have come of 
this because no temptation out of the common have pass pron1 way   but 
with _ pron1 _ the case be reverse   a temptation out of the common have

  pron1 make pron1 acknowledgment to the gentleman and leave pron1   the last 
chance be this chance and this have fail pron1   

ordinal1 

  the thought pron1 have once find pron1 way into pron1 mind already now find 
pron1 way back again and never altogether leave pron1 from that time forth

for the first time   pron1 write to beg pron1 pardon   to own that pron1 have 
proved to be right in pron1 opinion of pron1 husband   and to entreat pron1 
to be friend with pron1 again so far as to let pron1 visit pron1 from time 
to time   pron1 notion be that pron1 might soften pron1 heart if pron1 could see the 
old place and talk the old talk and look again at the well remember 
face   pron1 be almost ashamed to own pron1 but if pron1 have have any thing to 
give pron1 would have part with pron1 all to be allow to go back into

person1   when the medical gentleman hear pron1 pron1 be the medical 
gentleman come crowd round pron1   pron1 appear to lay hold of pron1 
interest just as a story book lay hold of the interest of other

person1 here be perform   

as pron1 turn to bid person1 person1 the uneasiness pron1 pron1 feel at

person1 wait on the low floor of the cottage while person1 close 
and lock the gate   pron1 have no wish to appear to avoid pron1 after the 
answer that pron1 have send to pron1 mother be message   pron1 return slowly 
half way across the front garden look toward the passage in which pron1 
be stand pass before the door and disappear round the corner 
of the cottage on pron1 way to the back garden   the inference be not to 
be mistaken   pron1 be person1 pron1 be avoid _ pron1 _ have pron1 lie to sir

bedroom door to come out   person1 person1 pron1 close pron1 again and 
remain invisible in pron1 room   once more the inference be not to be 
mistaken   person1 person1 also have pron1 reason for avoid person1 

pron1 do pron1 mean   what object could pron1 be in common between hester 
and person1 

pron1 be no fathom the meaning of pron1   person1 be thought revert to 
the communication which have be secretly make to pron1 by person1   pron1 
be not in womanhood to be insensible to such devotion as person1 person1 be 
conduct imply   terrible as pron1 position have become in pron1 ever grow 
uncertainty in pron1 never end suspense the oppression of pron1 yield 
for the moment to the glow of pride and gratitude which warm pron1 
heart as pron1 think of the sacrifice pron1 have be make of the 
peril pron1 be still to be encounter solely for pron1 sake   to 
shorten the period of suspense seem to be a duty which pron1 owe to sir 
person1 as well as to pron1   why in pron1 situation wait for pron1 the 
next day might bring forth   if the opportunity offer pron1 determine 
to put the signal in the window that night 

toward evening pron1 hear once more the noise which appear to indicate 
that repair of some sort be go on in the house   this time the 
sound be fainter   and pron1 come as pron1 fancy not from the spare 
room as before but from person1 be room next to pron1 

the dinner be late than usual that day   person1 person1 do not 
appear with the tray till dusk   person1 speak to pron1 and receive a mute 
sign in answer   determine to see the woman be face plainly pron1 put 
a question which require a write answer on the slate   and tell 
hester to wait go to the mantle piece to light pron1 candle   when pron1 
turn round with the light candle in pron1 hand hester be go 

night come   pron1 ring pron1 bell to have the tray take away   the fall of 
a strange footstep startle pron1 outside pron1 door   pron1 call out pron1 be 
there   the voice of the lad pron1 person1 employ to go on errand for 
pron1 answer pron1 

  pron1 do pron1 want here   pron1 ask through the door 

  person1   person1 send pron1 up person1 am   pron1 wish to speak to pron1 directly   

person1 find person1 in the dining room   pron1 object in wish to speak 
to pron1 be on the surface of pron1 trivial enough   pron1 want to know 
how pron1 would prefer go to person1 house on the next day by the 
railway or in a carriage   if pron1 prefer drive pron1 say the boy 
have come here for order and pron1 can tell pron1 to send a carriage from 
the livery stable as pron1 go home   

  the railway will do perfectly well for pron1 person1 reply 

instead of accept the answer and drop the subject pron1 ask pron1 
to reconsider pron1 decision   pron1 be an absent uneasy expression in 
pron1 eye as pron1 beg pron1 not to consult economy at the expense of pron1 
own comfort   pron1 appear to have some reason of pron1 own for prevent 
pron1 from leave the room   person1 person1 own a minute and think before pron1 
decide pron1 say   have force pron1 to take a chair pron1 put pron1 head 
outside the door and direct the lad to go up stair and see if pron1 have 
left pron1 pipe in pron1 bedroom   pron1 want pron1 to go in comfort as a lady 
should pron1 repeat with the uneasy look more marked than ever   before 
person1 could reply the lad be voice reach pron1 from the bedroom floor 
raise in shrill alarm and scream fire   

person1 run up stair   person1 follow pron1   the lad meet pron1 at the 
top of the stair   pron1 point to the open door of person1 be room   pron1 be 
absolutely certain of have leave pron1 light candle when pron1 go down 
to person1 at a safe distance from the bed curtain   the bed curtain 
nevertheless be in a blaze of fire 

pron1 be a supply of water to the cottage on the upper floor   the 
bedroom jug and can usually in pron1 place at an early hour be 
stand that night at the cistern   an empty pail be leave near pron1 
direct the lad to bring pron1 water from these resource person1 tear 
down the curtain in a flame heap partly on the bed and partly on the 
sofa near pron1   use the can and the pail alternately as the boy bring 
pron1 pron1 drench the bed and the sofa   pron1 be all over in little 
more than a minute   the cottage be save   but the bed furniture 
be destroy   and the room as a matter of course be render 
uninhabitable for that night at least and probably for more night to 
come 

person1 set down the empty pail   and turn to person1 point across 
the passage 

  pron1 will not be much inconvenience by this pron1 say   pron1 have only to 
shift pron1 quarter to the spare room   

with the assistance of the lad pron1 move person1 be box and the chest of 
drawer which have escape damage into the opposite room   this do 
pron1 caution pron1 to be careful with pron1 candle for the future and go 
down stair without wait to hear pron1 pron1 say in reply   the lad 
follow pron1 and be dismiss for the night 

even in the confusion which attend the extinguishing of the fire the 
conduct of person1 person1 have be remarkable enough to force pron1 
on the attention of person1 

pron1 have come out from pron1 bedroom when the alarm be give   have look 
at the flame curtain   and have draw back stolidly submissive into 
a corner to wait the event   there pron1 have stand to all appearance 
utterly indifferent to the possible destruction of pron1 own cottage   the 
fire extinguish pron1 still wait impenetrably in pron1 corner while 
the chest of drawer and the box be be move then lock the 
door without even a pass glance at the scorch ceiling and the 
burn bed furniture put the key into pron1 pocket and go back to pron1 
room 

person1 have hitherto not share the conviction feel by most other person 
pron1 be bring into contact with person1 person1 that the woman be 
mind be derange   after pron1 pron1 have just see however the general 
impression become pron1 impression too   pron1 have think of put certain 
question to hester when pron1 be leave together as to the origin of 
the fire   person1 decide pron1 on say pron1 for that night at 
least   pron1 cross the passage and enter the spare room the room 
which pron1 have decline to occupy on pron1 arrival at the cottage and 
which pron1 be oblige to sleep in now 

pron1 be instantly strike by a change in the disposition of the furniture 
of the room 

the bed have be move   the head set when pron1 have last see pron1 
against the side wall of the cottage be place now against the 
partition wall which separate the room from person1 be room   this new 
person1 have evidently be effect with a settle purpose of some 
sort   the hook in the ceiling which support the curtain the bed 
unlike the bed in the other room have no canopy attach to pron1 have 
be move so as to adapt pron1 to the change pron1 have be make   the 
chair and the washhand stand formerly place against the partition 
person1 be now as a matter of necessity shift over to the vacant 
space against the side wall of the cottage   for the rest no other 
alteration be visible in any part of the room 

in person1 be situation any event not immediately intelligible on the face 
of pron1 be an event to be distrust   be pron1 a motive for the change 
in the position of the bed   and be pron1 by any chance a motive in which 
pron1 be concern 

the doubt have barely occur to pron1 before a startling suspicion 
succeed pron1   be pron1 some secret purpose to be answer by make pron1 
sleep in the spare room   do the question which the servant have hear 
person1 put to hester on the previous night refer to this   have the 
fire which have so unaccountably catch the curtain in pron1 own room 
be by any possibility a fire purposely kindle to force pron1 out 

pron1 drop into the near chair faint with horror as those ordinal1 
question force pron1 in rapid succession on pron1 mind 

after wait a little pron1 recover self possession enough to 
recognize the first plain necessity of put pron1 suspicion to the 
test   pron1 be possible that pron1 excited fancy have fill pron1 with a 
purely visionary alarm   for all pron1 know to the contrary pron1 might be 
some undeniably sufficient reason for change the position of the bed 
pron1 go out and knock at the door of person1 person1 be room 

  pron1 want to speak to pron1 pron1 say 

person1 come out   person1 point to the spare room and lead the way to pron1 
person1 follow pron1 

  why have pron1 change the place of the bed pron1 ask from the wall 
there to the wall here   

stolidly submissive to the question as pron1 have be stolidly submissive 
to the fire person1 person1 write pron1 reply   on all other occasion 
pron1 be accustomed to look the person to pron1 pron1 offer pron1 slate 
steadily in the face   now for the first time pron1 hand pron1 to person1 
with pron1 eye on the floor   the ordinal1 line write contain no direct 
answer the word be these 

  pron1 have mean to move pron1 for some time past   

  pron1 ask pron1 why pron1 have move pron1   

pron1 write these ordinal1 word on the slate the wall be damp   

person1 look at the wall   pron1 be no sign of damp on the paper   pron1 
pass pron1 hand over pron1   feel where pron1 might the wall be dry 

  pron1 be not pron1 reason pron1 say 

person1 stand immovable 

  pron1 be no dampness in the wall   

person1 point persistently with pron1 pencil to the ordinal1 word still 
without look up wait a moment for person1 to read pron1 again and 
left the room 

pron1 be plainly useless to call pron1 back   person1 be first impulse when pron1 
be alone again be to secure the door   pron1 not only lock pron1 but 
bolt pron1 at top and bottom   the mortise of the lock and the staple 
of the bolt when pron1 try pron1 be firm   the lurking 
treachery wherever else pron1 might be be not in the fastening of the 
door 

pron1 look all round the room   examine the fire place the window and 
pron1 shutter the interior of the wardrobe the hide space under the 
bed   pron1 be any where to be discover which could justify the most 
person1 person live in feel suspicion or alarm 

appearance fair as pron1 be fail to convince pron1   the presentiment 
of some hide treachery steadily get near and near to pron1 in 
the dark have root pron1 firmly in pron1 mind   pron1 sit down and try 
to trace pron1 way back to the clew through the early event of the 
day 

the effort be fruitless pron1 definite pron1 tangible reward 
pron1   bad still a new doubt grow out of pron1 a doubt whether the motive 
which person1 person1 have avow through person1 be the motive for 
help pron1 which be really in pron1 mind 

do pron1 sincerely believe person1 be conduct to be animate by no bad 
object than a mercenary object   and be pron1 only purpose in plan to 
remove pron1 out of pron1 husband be reach to force person1 be consent to 
pron1 separation on the term which person1 have propose   be this really 
the sole end pron1 pron1 have in view   or be pron1 secretly convince know 
person1 be position as pron1 know pron1 that pron1 be in personal danger at the 
cottage   and have pron1 considerately keep that conviction conceal in 
the fear that pron1 might otherwise encourage pron1 to feel alarmed about 
pron1   pron1 look round the strange room in the silence of the 
night and pron1 feel that the latter interpretation be the likeli 
interpretation of the ordinal1 

the sound cause by the closing of the door and window reach pron1 
from the ground floor   pron1 be to be do 

pron1 be impossible to show the signal which have be agree on to person1 
person1 and person1   the window in which pron1 expect to see pron1 be 
the window of the room in which the fire have break out the room which 
person1 person1 have lock up for the night 

pron1 be equally hopeless to wait until the policeman pass on pron1 beat 
and to call for help   even if pron1 could prevail upon pron1 to make 
that open acknowledgment of distrust under pron1 husband be roof and even 
if help be near pron1 valid reason could pron1 give for raise an alarm 
pron1 be not the shadow of a reason to justify any one in place pron1 
under the protection of the law 

as a last resource impel by pron1 blind distrust of the change in the 
position of the bed pron1 attempt to move pron1   the utmost exertion of 
pron1 strength do not suffice to stir the heavy piece of furniture out of 
pron1 place by so much as a hair be breadth 

pron1 be no alternative but to trust to the security of the locked 
and bolt door and to keep watch through the night certain that person1 
person1 and person1 be on pron1 part also keep watch in the near 
neighborhood of the cottage   pron1 take out pron1 work and pron1 book   and 
return to pron1 chair place pron1 near the table in the middle of the 
room 

the last noise which tell of life and movement about pron1 die away   the 
breathless stillness of the night close round pron1
