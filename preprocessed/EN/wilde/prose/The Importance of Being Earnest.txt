person1 
pron1 dear algy pron1 talk exactly as if pron1 be a dentist   pron1 be very vulgar to talk like a dentist when pron1 be not a dentist   pron1 produce a false impression 

person1 
well that be exactly pron1 dentist always do   now go on   tell pron1 the whole thing   pron1 may mention that pron1 have always suspect pron1 of be a confirmed and secret bunburyist   and pron1 be quite sure of pron1 now 

person1 
person1   pron1 on earth do pron1 mean by a bunburyist 

person1

person1 
well produce pron1 cigarette case first 

person1 
here pron1 be   person1 cigarette case   now produce pron1 explanation and pray make pron1 improbable   sit on sofa

person1 
that be pron1 to pron1 dear boy   pron1 be not go to be invite           pron1 may tell pron1 candidly that the place be not in person1 

person1 
pron1 suspect that pron1 dear fellow   pron1 have bunburye all over person1 on ordinal1 separate occasion   now go on   why be pron1 ernest in town and jack in the country 

person1 
pron1 dear algy pron1 do not know whether pron1 will be able to understand pron1 real motive   pron1 be hardly serious enough   when pron1 be place in the position of guardian one have to adopt a very high moral tone on all subject   pron1 be ordinal1 be duty to do so   and as a high moral tone can hardly be say to conduce very much to either one be health or one be happiness in order to get up to town pron1 have always pretend to have a young brother of the name of ernest pron1 live in the person1 and get into the most dreadful scrape   that pron1 dear algy be the whole truth pure and simple 

person1 
the truth be rarely pure and never simple   modern life would be very tedious if pron1 be either and modern literature a complete impossibility 

person1 
that would not be at all a bad thing 

person1 
literary criticism be not pron1 forte pron1 dear fellow   do not try pron1   pron1 should leave that to people pron1 have not be at a university   pron1 do pron1 so well in the daily paper   pron1 pron1 really be be a bunburyist   pron1 be quite right in say pron1 be a bunburyist   pron1 be ordinal1 of the most advanced bunburyist pron1 know 

person1 
pron1 on earth do pron1 mean 

person1 
pron1 have invent a very useful young brother call ernest in order that pron1 may be able to come up to town as often as pron1 like   pron1 have invent an invaluable permanent invalid call bunbury in order that pron1 may be able to go down into the country whenever pron1 choose   person1 be perfectly invaluable   if pron1 be not for person1 be extraordinary bad health for instance pron1 would not be able to dine with pron1 at person1 be to night for pron1 have be really engage to aunt augusta for more than a week 

person1 
pron1 have not ask pron1 to dine with pron1 anywhere to night 

person1 
pron1 know   pron1 be absurdly careless about send out invitation   pron1 be very foolish of pron1   pron1 annoy people so much as not receive invitation 

person1 
pron1 have much well dine with pron1 aunt augusta 

person1 
pron1 have not the small intention of do pron1 of the kind   to begin with pron1 dine there on person1 and once a week be quite enough to dine with ordinal1 be own relation   in the second place whenever pron1 do dine there pron1 be always treat as a member of the family and send down with either no woman at all or ordinal1   in the third place pron1 know perfectly well pron1 pron1 will place pron1 next to to night   pron1 will place pron1 next person1 person1 pron1 always flirt with pron1 own husband across the dinner table   that be not very pleasant   indeed pron1 be not even decent           and that sort of thing be enormously on the increase   the amount of woman in person1 pron1 flirt with pron1 own husband be perfectly scandalous   pron1 look so bad   pron1 be simply wash ordinal1 be clean linen in public   besides now that pron1 know pron1 to be a confirm bunburyist pron1 naturally want to talk to pron1 about bunburye   pron1 want to tell pron1 the rule 

person1 
pron1 be not a bunburyist at all   if person1 accept pron1 pron1 be go to kill pron1 brother indeed pron1 think pron1 will kill pron1 in any case   person1 be a little too much interested in pron1   pron1 be rather a bore   so pron1 be go to get rid of ernest   and pron1 strongly advise pron1 to do the same with person1 person1            with pron1 invalid friend pron1 have the absurd name 

person1 
pron1 will induce pron1 to part with bunbury and if pron1 ever get marry which seem to pron1 extremely problematic pron1 will be very glad to know person1   a man pron1 marry without know person1 have a very tedious time of pron1 

person1 
that be nonsense   if pron1 marry a charming girl like person1 and pron1 be the only girl pron1 ever see in pron1 life pron1 pron1 would marry pron1 certainly will not want to know person1 

person1 
then pron1 wife will   pron1 do not seem to realise that in married life ordinal1 be company and ordinal1 be none 

person1 
  sententiously   that pron1 dear young friend be the theory that the corrupt french drama have be propound for the last ordinal1 year 

person1 
yes   and that the happy english home have prove in half the time 

person1 
for person1 be sake do not try to be cynical   pron1 be perfectly easy to be cynical 

person1 
pron1 dear fellow pron1 be not easy to be pron1 nowadays   pron1 be such a lot of beastly competition about   the sound of an electric bell be hear   ah   that must be aunt person1   only relative or creditor ever ring in that wagnerian manner   now if pron1 get pron1 out of the way for ordinal1 minute so that pron1 can have an opportunity for propose to person1 may pron1 dine with pron1 to night at person1 be 

person1 
pron1 suppose so if pron1 want to 

person1
