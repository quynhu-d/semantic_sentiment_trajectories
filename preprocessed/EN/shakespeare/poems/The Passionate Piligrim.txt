thus vainly think that pron1 think pron1 young 
although pron1 know pron1 year be past the good 
pron1 smile credit pron1 false speak tongue 
outface fault in love with love be ill rest 
but wherefore say pron1 love that pron1 be young 
and wherefore say not pron1 that pron1 be old 
o love be good habit be a soothing tongue 
and age in love love not to have year tell 
therefore pron1 will lie with love and love with pron1 
since that pron1 fault in love thus smother would be

pron1 vow be earthly thou a heavenly love 
thy grace be gain would cure all disgrace in pron1 
pron1 vow be breath and breath a vapour be 
then thou fair sun pron1 on this earth doth shine 
exhale this vapour vow   in pron1 pron1 be

sweet person1 sit by a brook 
with young adoni lovely fresh and green 
do court the lad with many a lovely look 
such look as none could look but beauty be queen 
pron1 tell pron1 story to delight pron1 ear 
pron1 show would pron1 favour to allure pron1 eye 
to win pron1 heart pron1 touch would pron1 here and there 
touch so soft still conquer chastity 
but whether unripe year do want conceit 
or pron1 refu would to take pron1 figur would proffer 
the tender nibbler would not touch the bait 
but smile and jest at every gentle offer 
then fall pron1 on pron1 back fair queen and toward

if love make pron1 forswear how shall pron1 swear to love 
o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow

where all those pleasure live that art can comprehend 
if knowledge be the mark to know pron1 shall suffice

which be to pron1 some praise pron1 pron1 pron1 part admire

which not to anger bent be music and sweet fire 
celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong 
to sing person1 be praise with such an earthly tongue

and scarce the herd go to the hedge for shade 
when person1 all in love forlorn

mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty 
bright than glass and yet as glass be brittle

a lily pale with damask dye to grace pron1 
none fair nor none falser to deface pron1 
pron1 lip to mine how often hath pron1 join 
between each kiss pron1 oath of true love swear 
how many tale to please pron1 hath pron1 coin

pron1 bid love last and yet pron1 fall a turning 
be this a lover or a lecher whether

person1 
if music and sweet poetry agree 
as pron1 must need the sister and the brother 
then must the love be great notwixt thee and pron1 
because person1 person1 person1 the one and pron1 the other

that phoebus lute the queen of music make 
and pron1 in deep delight be chiefly drown would

person1 rise fair flower untimely pluck would soon vaded 
person1 would in the bud and vade in the spring 
bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded 
fair creature kill would too soon by death be sharp sting 
like a green plum pron1 hang upon a tree 
and fall through wind before the fall should be 
pron1 weep for pron1 and yet no cause pron1 have 
for why person1 leave ist pron1 pron1 in thy will 
and yet person1 leave ist pron1 more than pron1 do crave

and with pron1 lip on pron1 do act the seizure 
and as pron1 fetch breath away pron1 skip 
and would not take pron1 meaning nor pron1 pleasure 
ah that pron1 have pron1 lady at this bay

a shine gloss pron1 vadeth suddenly 
a flower pron1 die when first pron1 gin to bud 
a brittle glass pron1 be break presently 
a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower 
lost vade break dead within an hour 
and as good lose be person1 or never find 
as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh 
as flower dead lie wither would on the ground 
as broken glass no cement can redress 
so beauty blemish would once for ever be lose 
in spite of physic painting pain and cost

yet at pron1 parting sweetly do pron1 smile 
in scorn or friendship nill pron1 conster whether

when craft hath teach pron1 thus to say

and see the shepherd feed pron1 flock 
by shallow river by whose fall 
melodious bird sing madrigal 

pron1 will pron1 make pron1 a bed of rose 
with a ordinal1 fragrant posy 
a cap of flower and a kirtle

a belt of straw and ivy bud 
with coral clasp and amber stud 
and if these pleasure may pron1 move

as pron1 fall upon a day 
in the merry month of may 
sit in a pleasant shade 
which a grove of myrtle make 
beast do leap and bird do sing 
tree do grow and plant do spring 
pron1 do banish person1 
save the nightingale alone 
pron1 poor bird as all forlorn 
lean would pron1 breast up till a thorn 
and pron1 sing the person1 person1 person1 
that to hear pron1 be great pitty 
  person1 person1 person1 now would pron1 cry 
  person1 person1 by and by 

that to hear pron1 so complain 
scarce pron1 could from tear refrain 
for pron1 grief so lively show 
make pron1 think upon mine own 
ah think pron1 thou mourn person1 in vain 
none take pitty on pron1 pain 
senseless tree pron1 can not hear pron1 
ruthless bear pron1 will not cheer pron1 
person1 pandion pron1 be dead 
all pron1 friend be lapp would in lead 
all pron1 fellow bird do sing 
careless of pron1 sorrowing 

whilst as fickle fortune smile 
thou and pron1 be both beguiled 
every one pron1 flatter person1 
be no friend in misery 
word be easy like the wind 
faithful friend be hard to find 
every man will be pron1 friend 
whilst thou hast wherewith to spend 
but if store of crown be scant 
no man will supply thy want 
if that one be prodigal 
bountiful pron1 will pron1 call 
and with such like flattering 
  pity but pron1 be a king   

if pron1 be addict to vice 
quickly pron1 pron1 will entice 
if to woman pron1 be bent 
pron1 have at commandement 
but if fortune once do frown 
then farewell pron1 great renown 
pron1 that fawn would on pron1 before 
use pron1 company no more 
pron1 that be pron1 friend indeed 
pron1 will help pron1 in thy need 
if thou sorrow pron1 will weep 
if pron1 wake pron1 can not sleep 
thus of every grief in heart 
pron1 with pron1 doth bear a part 
these be certain sign to know 
faithful friend from person1 ring foe
