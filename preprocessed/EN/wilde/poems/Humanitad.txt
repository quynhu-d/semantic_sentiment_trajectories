humanitad 
pron1 be full winter now the tree be bare 
save where the cattle huddle from the cold 
beneath the pine for pron1 doth never wear 
the autumn be gaudy livery whose gold 
pron1 jealous brother pilfer but be true 
to the green doublet   bitter be the wind as though pron1 blow 

from saturn be cave   a few thin wisp of hay 
lie on the sharp black hedge where the person1 
drag the sweet pillage of a summer be day 
from the low meadow up the narrow lane 
upon the half thaw snow the bleat sheep 
press close against the hurdle and the shiver house dog creep 

from the shut stable to the frozen stream 
and back again disconsolate and miss 
the bawl shepherd and the noisy team 
and overhead in circle person1 
the caw rook whirl round the frosted stack 
or crowd the dripping bough   and in the fen the ice pool crack 

where the gaunt bittern stalk among the reed 
and flap pron1 wing and stretch back pron1 neck 
and hoot to see the moon   across the mead 
limp the poor frighten hare a little speck 
and a stray seamew with pron1 fretful cry 
flit like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky 

full winter and the person1 person1 bring 
pron1 load of faggot from the person1 person1 
and stamp pron1 foot upon the hearth and fling 
the sappy billet on the wane fire 
and laugh to see the sudden lighten scare 
pron1 child at pron1 play and yet the spring be in the air 

already the slim crocus stir the snow 
and soon person1 person1 field will bloom again 
with nod cowslip for some lad to mow 
for with the first warm kiss of the rain 
the winter be icy sorrow break to tear 
and the brown thrush mate and with bright eye the rabbit peer 

from the dark person1 where the fir cone lie 
and tread ordinal1 snowdrop under foot and run 
over the mossy person1 and blackbird fly 
across pron1 path at evening and the sun 
stay long with pron1   ah   how good to see 
grass girdle spring in all pron1 joy of laugh greenery 

dance through the hedge till the early rise 
  that sweet repentance of the thorny briar   
burst from pron1 sheathèd emerald and disclose 
the little quiver disk of golden fire 
which the bee know so well for with pron1 come 
pale boy be love sop in wine and daffadillie all in bloom 

then up and down the field the sower go 
while close behind the laugh younker scare 
with shrilly whoop the black and thievish crow 
and then the chestnut tree pron1 glory wear 
and on the grass the creamy blossom fall 
in odorous excess and faint half whisper madrigal 

steal from the bluebell nod carillon 
each breezy morn and then person1 person1 
that star of pron1 own person1 snap dragon 
with loll crimson tongue and eglantine 
in dusty velvet clothe usurp the bed 
and woodland empery and when the linger rise hath shed 

red leaf by leaf pron1 fold panoply 
and pansy close pron1 purple lidde eye 
person1 from gilded argosy 
unload pron1 gaudy scentless merchandise 
and violet get overbold withdraw 
from pron1 shy nook and scarlet berry dot the leafless haw 

o happy field   and o thrice happy tree 
soon will pron1 queen in daisy flower smock 
and crown of flower person1 person1 trip down the person1 
soon will the lazy shepherd drive pron1 flock 
back to the pasture by the pool and soon 
through the green leave will float the hum of murmur bee at noon 

soon will the glade be bright with bellamour 
the flower which wanton love and those sweet nun 
vale lily in pron1 snowy vestiture 
will tell pron1 bead pearl and carnation 
with mitred dusky leave will scent the wind 
and straggle traveller be joy each hedge with yellow star will bind 

dear bride of nature and most bounteous spring 
that canst give increase to the sweet breath would person1 
and to the kid pron1 little horn and bring 
the soft and silky blossom to the vine 
where be that old person1 which of yore 
man get from poppy root and glossy berried mandragore 

pron1 be a time when any common bird 
could make pron1 sing in unison a time 
when all the string of boyish life be stir 
to quick response or more melodious rhyme 
by every forest idyll   do pron1 change 
or rather doth some evil thing through pron1 fair pleasaunce range 

nay nay thou art the same notis pron1 pron1 seek 
to vex with sigh pron1 simple solitude 
and because fruitless tear bedew pron1 cheek 
would have pron1 weep with pron1 in brotherhood 
fool   shall each wrong and restless spirit dare 
to taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair 

thou art the same notis pron1 whose wretched soul 
take discontent to be pron1 person1 
and give pron1 kingdom to the rude control 
of pron1 should be pron1 servitor for sure 
wisdom be somewhere though the stormy sea 
contain pron1 not and the huge deep answer tis not in pron1   

to burn with ordinal1 clear flame to stand erect 
in natural honour not to bend the knee 
in profitless prostration whose effect 
be by pron1 condemn pron1 alchemy 
can teach pron1 this   pron1 herb medea brew 
will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued 

the minor chord which end the harmony 
and for pron1 answer brother wait in vain 
sob for incomplete melody 
die a swan be death   but pron1 the heir of pain 
a silent memnon with blank lidless eye 
wait for the light and music of those sun which never rise 

the quench out torch the lonely cypress gloom 
the little dust store in the narrow urn 
the gentle of the attic tomb 
be not these well far than to return 
to pron1 old fitful restless malady 
or spend pron1 day within the voiceless cave of misery 

nay   for perchance that person1 person1 person1 
be like the watcher by a sick man be bed 
pron1 talk of sleep but give pron1 not   pron1 rod 
person1 lose pron1 virtue and when all be say 
death be too rude too obvious a key 
to solve ordinal1 single secret in a life be philosophy 

and love   that noble madness whose person1 
and inextinguishable might can slay 
the soul with honeyed drug alas   pron1 must 
from such sweet ruin play the runaway 
although too constant memory never can 
forget the arched splendour of those brow olympian 

which for a little season make pron1 youth 
so soft a swoon of exquisite indolence 
that all the chiding of more prudent truth 
seem the thin voice of jealousy o hence 
thou huntress deadly than person1 
go seek some other quarry   for of thy too perilous bliss 

pron1 lip have drink enough no more no more 
though love pron1 should turn pron1 gilded prow 
back to the troubled water of this shore 
where pron1 be wreck and strand even now 
the chariot wheel of passion sweep too near 
hence   hence   pron1 pass unto a life more barren more austere 

more barren ay those arm will never lean 
down through the trellis vine and draw pron1 soul 
in sweet reluctance through the tangle green 
some other head must wear that aureole 
for pron1 be pron1 pron1 love not any man 
pron1 white and stainless bosom bear the sign gorgonian 

let person1 go and chuck pron1 dainty page 
and kiss pron1 mouth and toss pron1 curly hair 
with net and spear and hunt equipage 
let young adoni to pron1 tryst repair 
but pron1 pron1 fond and subtle fashioned spell 
delight no more though pron1 could win pron1 person1 person1 

ay though pron1 be that laugh shepherd boy 
pron1 from person1 person1 see the little cloud 
pass over tenedo and person1 person1 
and know the coming of the queen and bow 
in wonder at pron1 foot not for the sake 
of a new person1 would pron1 bid pron1 hand the apple take 

then rise supreme person1 person1 limbe 
and if pron1 lip be musicless person1 
at least pron1 life be not pron1 glory hymn 
by ordinal1 pron1 give to pron1 pron1 sword and person1 
like aeschylo at well fight marathon 
and die to show that person1 be person1 still could bear a son 

and yet pron1 can not tread the portico 
and live without desire fear and pain 
or nurture that wise calm which long ago 
the grave athenian master teach to man 
self poise self centre and self comfort 
to watch the world be vain phantasy go by with unbowed head 

alas   that serene brow those eloquent lip 
those eye pron1 mirror all eternity 
rest in pron1 own person1 an eclipse 
person1 come on wisdom and mnemosyne 
be childless   in the night which pron1 have make 
for lofty secure flight person1 be owl pron1 hath stray 

nor much with science do pron1 care to climb 
although by strange and subtle witchery 
pron1 draw the moon from person1 the person1 time 
unroll pron1 gorgeous coloured tapestry 
to no less eager eye   often indeed 
in the great epic of person1 be scroll pron1 love to read 

how person1 send pron1 myriad host to war 
against a little town and person1 
in gilded mail with jewel scimitar 
person1 shield purple crested ride the mede 
between the wave poplar and the sea 
which man call artemisium till pron1 see thermopylæ 

pron1 steep ravine span by a narrow wall 
and on the near side a little brood 
of careless lion hold festival 
and stand amazèd at such hardihood 
and pitch pron1 tent upon the person1 shore 
and stay ordinal1 day to wonder and then creep at midnight o er 

some unfrequented height and come down 
the autumn forest treacherously 
pron1 sparta hold most dear and be the crown 
of far eurota and pass on nor know 
how person1 have stake an evil net for pron1 
in the small bay at person1 and yet the page grow dim 

pron1 cadence greek delight pron1 not pron1 feel 
with such a goodly time too out of tune 
to love pron1 much for like the dial be wheel 
that from pron1 blind darkness strike the noon 
yet never see the sun so do pron1 eye 
restlessly follow that which from pron1 cheat vision fly 

o for ordinal1 grand unselfish simple life 
to teach pron1 pron1 be wisdom   speak pron1 hill 
of lone helvellyn for this note of strife 
shun pron1 untroubled crag and crystal rill 
where be that spirit which live blamelessly 
yet dare to kiss the smitten mouth of pron1 own century 

speak pron1 rydalian laurel   where be pron1 
whose gentle head ye shelter that pure soul 
whose gracious day of uncrowned person1 
through lowly conduct touch the lofty goal 
where love and duty mingle   pron1 at least 
the most high law be glad of pron1 have sit at wisdom be feast 

but pron1 be learn be changeling know by rote 
the person1 watchword of each grecian school 
and follow none the flawless sword which smote 
the pagan person1 be an effete tool 
which pron1 pron1 have blunt pron1 man now 
shall scale the person1 ancient height and to old reverence bow 

ordinal1 such indeed pron1 see but person1 
gone be that last dear son of person1 
pron1 be man die for the sake of person1 
and whose unrisen bone sleep peacefully 
o guard pron1 guard pron1 well pron1 giotto be tower 
thou marble lily of the lily town   let not the lour 

of the rude tempest person1 pron1 slumber or 
the arno with pron1 tawny trouble gold 
o er leap pron1 marge no mighty conqueror 
clomb the high capitol in the day of old 
when person1 be indeed person1 for liberty 
walk like a bride beside pron1 at which sight pale mystery 

fled shriek to pron1 farth sombrest cell 
with an old man pron1 grabble rusty key 
fled shudder for that person1 person1 
with which oblivion burie dynasty 
person1 like a wound eagle on the blast 
as to the holy heart of person1 the great person1 pass 

pron1 know the holy heart and height of person1 
pron1 drave the base wolf from the lion be lair 
and now lie dead by that empyreal dome 
which overtop valdarno hang in air 
by person1 o melpomene 
breathe through pron1 melancholy pipe person1 person1 threnody 

breathe through the tragic stop such melody 
that joy be self may grow jealous and the ordinal1 
forget awhile pron1 discreet emperie 
mourn for pron1 pron1 on person1 be person1 person1 
lit for man be life the light of marathon 
and bare to sun forget field the fire of the sun 

o guard pron1 guard pron1 well pron1 giotto be tower 
let some young florentine each eventide 
bring coronal of that enchanted flower 
which the dim wood of person1 hide 
and deck the marble tomb wherein pron1 lie 
whose soul be as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eye 

some mighty orb whose cycle wandering 
be tempest drive to the farth rim 
where chaos meet creation and the wing 
of the eternal chant cherubim 
be pavilioned on pron1 pass away 
into a moonless void and yet though pron1 be dust and clay 

pron1 be not dead the immemorial fate 
forbid pron1 and the closing shear refrain 
lift up pron1 head ye everlasting gate 
person1 argent clarion sound a person1 strain 
for the vile thing pron1 hate lurk within 
pron1 sombre house alone with person1 and memory of sin 

still pron1 avail pron1 that pron1 seek pron1 cave 
that murderous mother of person1 harlotry 
at person1 on the marble architrave 
the grecian boy die smile but the sea 
which wash aegina fret in loneliness 
not mirror pron1 beauty   so pron1 life grow colourless 

for lack of pron1 ideal if ordinal1 star 
flame torch like in the heaven the unjust 
swift daylight kill pron1 and no trump of war 
can wake to passionate voice the silent dust 
which be mazzini once   person1 niobe 
for all pron1 stony sorrow hath pron1 son   but person1 

pron1 easter day shall make pron1 child rise 
pron1 be not god yet suffer   pron1 sure foot 
shall find pron1 grave clothe fold   pron1 clear eye 
shall see pron1 bodily   o pron1 be meet 
to roll the stone from off the sepulchre 
and kiss the bleed rose of pron1 wound in love of pron1 

pron1 person1   pron1 mother visible 
most blessed among nation and most sad 
for whose dear sake the young calabrian fall 
that day at aspromonte and be glad 
that in an age when person1 be buy and sell 
ordinal1 man could die for liberty   but pron1 burn out and cold 

see honour smite on the cheek and gyve 
bind the sweet foot of mercy poverty 
creep through pron1 sunless lane and with sharp knife 
cut the warm throat of child stealthily 
and no word say o pron1 be wretched man 
unworthy of pron1 great inheritance   where be the pen 

of austere milton   where the mighty sword 
which slew pron1 master righteously   the year 
have lose pron1 ancient leader and no word 
break from the voiceless tripod on pron1 ear 
while as a ruin mother in some spasm 
bear a base child and loathe pron1 so pron1 good enthusiasm 

gender unlawful child anarchy 
freedom be own person1 the vile prodigal 
licence pron1 steal the gold of liberty 
and yet have pron1 ignorance the real 
ordinal1 fraticide since person1 envy the asp 
that sting pron1 to anguish person1 whose palsied grasp 

be in pron1 extent stiffen moneyed greed 
for whose dull appetite man waste away 
amid the whirr of wheel and be the seed 
of thing which slay pron1 sower these each day 
see rife in person1 and the gentle foot 
of beauty tread no more the stone of each unlovely street 

pron1 even person1 spare be desecrate 
by weed and worm leave to the stormy play 
of wind and beat snow or renovate 
by more destructful hand time be bad decay 
will wreathe pron1 ruin with some loveliness 
but these new vandal can but make a rain proof barrenness 

where be that art which bid the angel sing 
through person1 be lofty choir till the air 
seem from such marble harmony to ring 
with sweet song than common lip can dare 
to draw from actual reed   ah   where be now 
the cunning hand which make the flower hawthorn branch bow 

for southwell be arch and carve the house of ordinal1 
pron1 love the lily of the field with all 
pron1 dear english flower   the same sun 
rise for pron1 the season natural 
weave the same tapestry of green and person1 
the unchanged hill be with pron1 but that spirit hath pass away 

and yet perchance pron1 may be well so 
for tyranny be an incestuous queen 
murder pron1 brother be pron1 bedfellow 
and the plague chamber with pron1 in obscene 
and bloody path pron1 treacherous foot be set 
well the empty desert and a soul inviolate 

for gentle brotherhood the harmony 
of live in the healthful air the swift 
clean beauty of strong limb when man be free 
and woman chaste these be the thing which lift 
pron1 soul up more than even agnolo be 
person1 blind sibyl pore o er the scroll of human woe 

or person1 be little maiden on the stair 
white as pron1 own sweet lily and as tall 
or person1 person1 smile through pron1 hair 
ah   somehow life be big after all 
than any paint angel could pron1 see 
the person1 pron1 be within pron1   the old greek serenity 

which curb the passion of that level line 
of marble youth pron1 with untroubled eye 
and chastened limb ride round person1 be shrine 
and mirror pron1 divine economy 
and balanced symmetry of pron1 in man 
would else wage ceaseless warfare this at least within the span 

between pron1 mother be kiss and the grave 
might so inform pron1 life that pron1 could win 
such mighty empire that from pron1 cave 
temptation would grow hoarse and pallid sin 
would walk ashamed of pron1 adultery 
and passion creep from out the house of lust with startled eye 

to make the body and the person1 one 
with all right thing till no thing live in vain 
from morn to noon but in sweet unison 
with every pulse of flesh and throb of brain 
the soul in flawless essence high enthrone 
against all outer vain attack invincibly bastione 

person1 with serene impartiality 
the strife of thing and yet be comfort 
know that by the chain causality 
all separate existence be pron1 d 
into ordinal1 supreme whole whose utterance 
be joy or holy praise   ah   surely this be governance 

of life in most person1 omnipresence 
through which the rational intellect would find 
in passion pron1 expression and mere sense 
person1 else lend fire to the mind 
and be join with pron1 in harmony 
more mystical than that which bind the star planetary 

strike from pron1 several tone ordinal1 octave chord 
whose cadence be measureless would fly 
through all the circle sphere then to pron1 lord 
return refreshed with pron1 new empery 
and more exultant power this indeed 
could pron1 but reach pron1 be to find the last the perfect creed 

ah   pron1 be easy when the world be young 
to keep ordinal1 be life free and inviolate 
from pron1 sad lip another song be ring 
by pron1 own hand pron1 head be desecrate 
wanderer in drear exile and dispossess 
of pron1 should be pron1 own pron1 can but feed on wild unrest 

somehow the grace the bloom of thing have fly 
and of all man pron1 be most wretched pron1 
must live each other be life and not pron1 own 
for very pity be sake and then undo 
all pron1 pron1 live for pron1 be otherwise 
when soul and body seem to blend in mystic symphony 

but pron1 have leave those gentle haunt to pass 
with weary foot to the new calvary 
where pron1 behold as ordinal1 pron1 in a glass 
see pron1 own face self slay humanity 
and in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze 
learn pron1 an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise 

o smite mouth   o forehead crown with thorn 
o chalice of all common misery 
thou for pron1 sake pron1 love pron1 not hast bear 
an agony of endless century 
and pron1 be vain and ignorant nor know 
that when pron1 stab pron1 heart pron1 be pron1 own real heart pron1 slew 

be pron1 the sower and the seed 
the night pron1 cover and the light pron1 fade 
the spear pron1 pierce and the side pron1 bleed 
the lip betray and the life betray 
the deep hath calm the moon hath rest but pron1 
lord of the natural world be yet pron1 own dread enemy 

be this the end of all that primal force 
which in pron1 change be still the same 
from eyeless chaos cleft pron1 upward course 
through ravenous sea and whirl rock and flame 
till the sun meet in person1 and begin 
pron1 cycle and the morning star sing and the word be man 

nay nay pron1 be but crucify and though 
the bloody sweat fall from pron1 brow like rain 
loosen the nail pron1 shall come down pron1 know 
staunch the red wound pron1 shall be whole again 
no need have pron1 of person1 person1 person1 
that which be purely human pron1 be godlike that be person1
