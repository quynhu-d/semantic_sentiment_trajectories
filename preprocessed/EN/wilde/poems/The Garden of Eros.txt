the garden of eros 
pron1 be full summer now the heart of person1 
not yet the sunburnt reaper be astir 
upon the person1 meadow where too soon 
rich autumn time the season be usurer 
will lend pron1 hoard gold to all the tree 
and see pron1 treasure scatter by the wild and spendthrift breeze 

too soon indeed   yet here the daffodil 
that love child of the spring have linger on 
to vex the rise with jealousy and still 
the harebell spread pron1 azure pavilion 
and like a stray and wandering reveller 
abandon of pron1 brother pron1 long since person1 be messenger 

the missel thrush have fright from the person1 
ordinal1 pale narcissus loiter fearfully 
close to a shadowy nook where half afraid 
of pron1 own loveliness some violet lie 
that will not look the gold sun in the face 
for fear of too much splendour ah   methink pron1 be a place 

which should be trodden by persephone 
when weary of the flowerless field of person1 
or dance on by the lad of arcady 
the hidden secret of eternal bliss 
know to the grecian here a man might find 
ah   pron1 and pron1 may find pron1 now if love and sleep be kind 

pron1 be the flower which mourn herakle 
strew on the tomb of person1 person1 
pron1 white dove all a flutter where the breeze 
kiss pron1 too harshly the small celandine 
that yellow person1 person1 of eve 
and person1 lady be smock but let pron1 bloom alone and leave 

person1 person1 person1 person1 crockete 
to sway pron1 silent chime else must the bee 
pron1 little bellringer go seek instead 
some other pleasaunce   the anemone 
that weep at daybreak like a silly girl 
before pron1 love and hardly let the butterfly unfurl 

pron1 paint wing beside pron1 bid pron1 pine 
in pale virginity   the winter snow 
will suit pron1 well than those lip of thine 
whose fire would but scorch pron1 rather go 
and pluck that amorous flower which bloom alone 
feed by the pander wind with dust of kiss not pron1 own 

the trumpet mouth of red convolvulus 
so dear to maiden creamy meadow sweet 
person1 than person1 be throat and odorous 
as all arabia hyacinth the foot 
of huntress person1 would be loth to person1 
for any dappled fawn pluck these and those fond flower which be 

person1 than pron1 person1 person1 person1 upon 
beneath the pine of person1 person1 
that morning star which do not dread the sun 
and bud marjoram which but to kiss 
would sweeten cytheræa be lip and make 
person1 jealou these for pron1 head and for thy girdle take 

yon curve spray of purple clematis 
whose gorgeous dye outflame the tyrian king 
and foxglove with pron1 nod chalice 
but that ordinal1 narciss which the startled spring 
let from pron1 person1 fall when first pron1 hear 
in pron1 own wood the wild tempestuous song of summer be bird 

ah   leave pron1 for a subtle memory 
of those sweet tremulous day of rain and sun 
when person1 laugh between pron1 tear to see 
the early primrose with shy footstep run 
from the gnarled oak tree root till all the wold 
spite of pron1 brown and trample leave grow bright with shimmer gold 

nay pluck pron1 too pron1 be not half so sweet 
as thou pron1 pron1 soul be idolatry 
and when pron1 art a wearied at pron1 foot 
shall person1 weave pron1 bright tapestry 
for pron1 the woodbine shall forget pron1 pride 
and veil pron1 tangled whorls and thou shalt walk on daisy pie 

and pron1 will cut a reed by yonder spring 
and make the wood god jealous and old pan 
wonder pron1 young intruder dare to sing 
in these still haunt where never foot of man 
should tread at evening lest pron1 chance to spy 
the marble limb of person1 and all pron1 company 

and pron1 will tell pron1 why the jacinth wear 
such dread embroidery of dolorous moan 
and why the hapless nightingale forbear 
to sing pron1 song at noon but weep alone 
when the fleet swallow sleep and rich man feast 
and why the person1 tremble when pron1 see the lighten person1 

and pron1 will sing how sad proserpina 
unto a grave and gloomy person1 be pron1 d 
and lure the silver breasted person1 
back from the person1 meadow of the dead 
so shalt thou see that awful loveliness 
for which ordinal1 mighty host meet fearfully in war be abyss 

and then pron1 will pipe to pron1 that person1 person1 
how person1 love the lad endymion 
and hide in a grey and misty veil 
hie to the cliff of person1 once the sun 
person1 from pron1 ocean bed in fruitless chase 
of those pale fly foot which fade away in pron1 embrace 

and if pron1 flute can breathe sweet melody 
pron1 may behold pron1 face pron1 long ago 
person1 among man by the person1 person1 
and whose sad house with pillaged portico 
and person1 person1 and column topple down 
loom o er the ruin of that fair and violet cinctured town 

person1 of beauty   person1 still awhile 
pron1 be not dead thine ancient votary 
some few pron1 be to pron1 pron1 radiant smile 
be well than a ordinal1 victory 
though all the nobly slay of waterloo 
rise up in wrath against pron1   person1 still pron1 be a few 

pron1 for pron1 sake would give pron1 manlihood 
and consecrate pron1 being   pron1 at least 
have do so make pron1 lip pron1 daily food 
and in thy temple find a goodly feast 
than this starve age can give pron1 spite of all 
pron1 new find creed so sceptical and so dogmatical 

here not cephisso not person1 flow 
the wood of person1 person1 be not here 
on pron1 bleak hill the olive never blow 
no simple priest conduct pron1 low steer 
up the steep marble way nor through the town 
do laugh maiden bear to pron1 the crocus flower gown 

yet tarry   for the boy pron1 love pron1 good 
pron1 very name should be a memory 
to make pron1 linger sleep in silent rest 
beneath the roman wall and melody 
still mourn pron1 person1 person1   none can play 
the lute of person1 with pron1 lip song pass away 

person1 when keat die the muse still have leave 
ordinal1 silver voice to sing pron1 threnody 
but ah   too soon of pron1 pron1 be bereft 
when on that riven night and stormy sea 
person1 claim pron1 singer as pron1 own 
and slew the mouth pron1 praise pron1   since which time pron1 walk alone 

save for that fiery heart that morning star 
of re person1 person1 whose clear eye 
see from pron1 totter throne and waste of war 
the grand greek limb of young democracy 
rise mightily like hesperus and bring 
the great republic   pron1 at least pron1 love hath teach to sing 

and pron1 hath be with pron1 at person1 
and see white person1 fleet of foot 
in passionless and fierce virginity 
hunt the person1 boar pron1 honied lute 
person1 pierce the cavern of the person1 hill 
and person1 laugh to know ordinal1 knee will bow before pron1 still 

and pron1 hath kiss the lip of proserpine 
and sing the galilæan be requiem 
that wound forehead dash with blood and wine 
pron1 hath discrowne the ancient god in pron1 
have find pron1 last most ardent worshipper 
and the new sign grow grey and dim before pron1 conqueror 

person1 of beauty   person1 with pron1 still 
pron1 be not quench the torch of poesy 
the star pron1 shake above the person1 person1 
hold unassailed pron1 argent armoury 
from all the gathering gloom and fretful fight 
o tarry with pron1 still   for through the long and common night 

person1 pron1 sweet and simple chaucer be child 
dear heritor of person1 be tuneful reed 
with soft and person1 pipe have oft beguile 
the weary soul of man in troublous need 
and from the far and flowerless field of ice 
have bring fair flower to make an earthly paradise 

pron1 know pron1 all gudrun the strong man be bride 
person1 and olafson pron1 know pron1 all 
how giant person1 fight and person1 die 
and what enchantment hold the king in thrall 
when lonely person1 wrestle with the power 
that war against all passion ah   how oft through summer hour 

long listless summer hour when the noon 
be enamoured of a damask rise 
forget to journey westward till the moon 
the pale usurper of pron1 tribute grow 
from a thin sickle to a silver shield 
and chide pron1 loitering car how oft in some cool grassy field 

far from the cricket ground and noisy ordinal1 
at bagley where the rustle bluebell come 
almost before the person1 find a mate 
and overstay the swallow and the hum 
of many murmur bee flit through the leave 
have pron1 lain pore on the dreamy tale pron1 fancy weave 

and through pron1 unreal woe and mimic pain 
person1 for pron1 and so be purify 
and in pron1 simple mirth grow glad again 
for as pron1 sail upon that picture tide 
the strength and splendour of the storm be mine 
without the storm be red ruin for the singer be divine 

the little laugh of water fall down 
be not so musical the clammy gold 
close hoard in the tiny waxen town 
have less of sweetness in pron1 and the old 
half withered reed pron1 wave in arcady 
touch by pron1 lip break forth again to fresher harmony 

person1 of beauty tarry yet awhile 
although the cheat merchant of the mart 
with iron road profane pron1 lovely isle 
and break on whirling wheel the limb of art 
ay   though the crowded factory beget 
the blindworm ignorance pron1 slay the soul o tarry yet 

for ordinal1 at least pron1 be pron1 bear pron1 name 
from person1 and the person1 person1 
whose double laurel burn with deathless flame 
to light thine altar   pron1 too love pron1 well 
pron1 see old person1 lure in person1 be snare 
and the white foot of angel come down the golden stair 

love pron1 so well that all the world for pron1 
a gorgeous coloured vestiture must wear 
and sorrow take a purple diadem 
or else be no more sorrow and despair 
person1 pron1 own thorn and pain like person1 be 
even in anguish beautiful   such be the empery 

which painter hold and such the heritage 
this gentle solemn person1 person1 possess 
be a well mirror of pron1 age 
in all pron1 pity love and weariness 
than those pron1 can but copy common thing 
and leave the soul unpainte with pron1 mighty questioning 

but pron1 be few and all romance have fly 
and man can prophesy about the sun 
and lecture on pron1 arrow how alone 
through a waste void the soulless atom run 
how from each tree pron1 weep nymph have flee 
and that no more amid person1 reed a naiad show pron1 head 

methink these new actæon boast too soon 
that pron1 have spy on beauty   pron1 if pron1 
have analyse the rainbow rob the moon 
of pron1 most ancient chaste mystery 
shall pron1 the last endymion lose all hope 
because rude eye peer at pron1 mistress through a telescope 

what profit if this scientific age 
burst through pron1 gate with all pron1 retinue 
of modern miracle   can pron1 assuage 
ordinal1 lover be break heart   pron1 can pron1 do 
to make ordinal1 life more beautiful ordinal1 day 
more godlike in pron1 period   but now the age of clay 

return in horrid cycle and the earth 
person1 bear again a noisy progeny 
of ignorant titan whose ungodly birth 
person1 pron1 against the person1 hierarchy 
which sit upon olympu   to the dust 
pron1 have appeal and to that barren arbiter pron1 must 

repair for judgment   let pron1 if pron1 can 
from natural warfare and insensate chance 
create the new ideal rule for man 
methink pron1 be not pron1 inheritance 
for pron1 be nurture otherwise pron1 soul 
pass from high height of life to a more supreme goal 

person1   while pron1 spake the earth do turn away 
pron1 visage from the person1 and hecate be boat 
person1 silver laden till the jealous day 
person1 all pron1 torch out pron1 do not note 
the wane hour to young endymion 
time be palsied finger count in vain pron1 rosary of sun 

person1 how the yellow iris wearily 
lean back pron1 throat as though pron1 would be kiss 
by pron1 false chamberer the dragon fly 
pron1 like a blue vein on a girl be white wrist 
sleep on that person1 person1 of the night 
which gin to flush with crimson shame and die beneath the light 

come let pron1 go against the pallid shield 
of the person1 sky the almond blossom gleam 
the corncrake nest in the unmown field 
answer pron1 mate across the misty stream 
on fitful wing the startled curlews fly 
and in pron1 sedgy bed the lark for joy that day be nigh 

scatter the person1 dew from off the grass 
in tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun 
pron1 soon in gilded panoply will pass 
forth from person1 person1 person1 pavilion 
person1 in the burn east see the red rim 
o ertop the expectant hill   pron1 be the person1   for love of pron1 

already the shrill lark be out of sight 
flood with wave of song this silent person1 
ah   pron1 be pron1 more in that bird be flight 
than could be test in a crucible   
but the air freshen let pron1 go why soon 
the woodman will be here   how pron1 have live this night of person1
