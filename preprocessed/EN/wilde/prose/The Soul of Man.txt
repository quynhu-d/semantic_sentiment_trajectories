  the soul of man 


the chief advantage pron1 would result from the establishment of socialism 
be undoubtedly the fact that socialism would relieve pron1 from that 
sordid necessity of live for other which in the present condition of 
thing press so hardly upon almost pron1   in fact scarcely 
pron1 at all escape 

now and then in the course of the century a great man of science like 
person1   a great poet like keat   a fine critical spirit like m   person1 
a supreme artist like person1 have be able to isolate pron1 to 
keep pron1 out of reach of the clamorous claim of other to stand 
  under the shelter of the wall as plato put pron1 and so to realise the 
perfection of pron1 be in pron1 to pron1 own incomparable gain and to the 
incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world   these however be 
exception   the majority of people spoil pron1 life by an unhealthy and 
exaggerated altruism be force indeed so to spoil pron1   pron1 find 
pron1 surround by hideous poverty by hideous ugliness by hideous 
starvation   pron1 be inevitable that pron1 should be strongly move by all 
this   the emotion of man be stir more quickly than man be 
intelligence   and as pron1 point out some time ago in an article on the 
function of criticism pron1 be much more easy to have sympathy with 
suffer than pron1 be to have sympathy with thought   accordingly with 
admirable though misdirect intention pron1 very seriously and very 
person1 set pron1 to the task of remedy the evil pron1 pron1 
see   but pron1 remedy do not cure the disease pron1 merely prolong pron1 
indeed pron1 remedy be part of the disease 

pron1 try to solve the problem of poverty for instance by keep the 
poor alive   or in the case of a very advanced school by amuse the 
poor 

but this be not a solution pron1 be an aggravation of the difficulty   the 
proper aim be to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty 
will be impossible   and the altruistic virtue have really prevent the 
carry out of this aim   just as the bad slave owner be those pron1 
be kind to pron1 slave and so prevent the horror of the system 
be realise by those pron1 suffer from pron1 and understand by those pron1 
contemplate pron1 so in the present state of thing in person1 the 
people pron1 do most harm be the people pron1 try to do most good   and at 
last pron1 have have the spectacle of man pron1 have really study the problem 
and know the life educate man pron1 live in the east end come forward 
and implore the community to restrain pron1 altruistic impulse of 
charity benevolence and the like   pron1 do so on the ground that such 
charity degrade and person1   pron1 be perfectly right   person1 
create a multitude of sin 

pron1 be also this to be say   pron1 be immoral to use private property in 
order to alleviate the horrible evil pron1 result from the institution of 
private property   pron1 be both immoral and unfair 

under socialism all this will of course be alter   pron1 will be no 
people live in fetid dens and fetid rag and bring up unhealthy 
hunger pinch child in the midst of impossible and absolutely 
repulsive surrounding   the security of society will not depend as pron1 
do now on the state of the weather   if a frost come pron1 shall not 
have a ordinal1 ordinal1 man out of work tramp about the street in a 
state of disgusting misery or whine to pron1 neighbour for alm or 
crowd round the door of loathsome shelter to try and secure a hunch 
of bread and a night be unclean lodging   each member of the society will 
share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society and if a 
person1 come no one will practically be pron1 the bad 

upon the other hand socialism pron1 will be of value simply because pron1 
will lead to individualism 

socialism communism or whatever one choose to call pron1 by convert 
private property into public wealth and substitute co operation for 
competition will restore society to pron1 proper condition of a thoroughly 
healthy organism and insure the material well be of each member of 
the community   pron1 will in fact give life pron1 proper basis and pron1 
proper environment   but for the full development of life to pron1 high 
mode of perfection pron1 more be need   pron1 be need be 
individualism   if the socialism be authoritarian   if pron1 be 
government arm with economic power as pron1 be now with political 
power   if in a word pron1 be to have industrial tyranny then the last 
state of man will be bad than the first   at present in consequence of 
the existence of private property a great many people be enable to 
develop a certain very limited amount of individualism   pron1 be either 
under no necessity to work for pron1 living or be enable to choose the 
sphere of activity pron1 be really congenial to pron1 and give pron1 
pleasure   these be the poet the philosopher the man of science the 
man of culture in a word the real man the man pron1 have realise 
pron1 and in pron1 all humanity gain a partial realisation   upon 
the other hand pron1 be a great many people pron1 have no private 
property of pron1 own and be always on the brink of sheer starvation 
be compel to do the work of beast of burden to do work pron1 be 
quite uncongenial to pron1 and to which pron1 be force by the 
peremptory unreasonable degrade tyranny of want   these be the poor 
and amongst pron1 pron1 be no grace of manner or charm of speech or 
civilisation or culture or refinement in pleasure or joy of life 
from pron1 collective force humanity gain much in material prosperity 
but pron1 be only the material result that pron1 gain and the man pron1 be poor 
be in pron1 absolutely of no importance   pron1 be merely the 
infinitesimal atom of a force pron1 so far from regard pron1 crush 
pron1 indeed prefer pron1 crush as in that case pron1 be far more 
obedient 

of course pron1 might be say that the individualism generate under 
condition of private property be not always or even as a rule of a 
fine or wonderful type and that the poor if pron1 have not culture and 
charm have still many virtue   both these statement would be quite 
true   the possession of private property be very often extremely 
person1 and that be of course ordinal1 of the reason why socialism 
want to get rid of the institution   in fact property be really a 
nuisance   some year ago people go about the country say that 
property have duty   pron1 say pron1 so often and so tediously that at 
last the church have begin to say pron1   ordinal1 hear pron1 now from every 
person1   pron1 be perfectly true   person1 not merely have duty but have 
so many duty that pron1 possession to any large extent be a bore   pron1 
involve endless claim upon ordinal1 endless attention to business endless 
bother   if property have simply pleasure pron1 could stand pron1   but pron1 
duty make pron1 unbearable   in the interest of the rich pron1 must get rid 
of pron1   the virtue of the poor may be readily admit and be much to 
be regret   pron1 be often tell that the poor be grateful for charity 
some of pron1 be no doubt but the good amongst the poor be never 
grateful   pron1 be ungrateful discontent disobedient and 
rebellious   pron1 be quite right to be so   charity pron1 feel to be a 
ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution or a sentimental 
person1 usually accompany by some impertinent attempt on the part of the 
sentimentalist to tyrannise over pron1 private life   why should pron1 be 
grateful for the crumb pron1 fall from the rich man be table   pron1 should 
be seat at the board and be begin to know pron1   as for be 
discontent a man pron1 would not be discontent with such surrounding 
and such a low mode of life would be a perfect brute   person1 in 
the eye of pron1 pron1 have read history be man be original virtue   pron1 be 
through disobedience pron1 progress have be make through disobedience 
and through rebellion   sometimes the poor be praise for be thrifty 
but to recommend thrift to the poor be both grotesque and insulting   pron1 
be like advise a man pron1 be starve to eat less   for a town or 
country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral   man 
should not be ready to show that pron1 can live like a badly fed animal   pron1 
should decline to live like that and should either steal or go on the 
rate which be consider by many to be a form of steal   as for 
beg pron1 be safe to beg than to take but pron1 be fine to take than to 
person1   no a poor man pron1 be ungrateful person1 discontent and 
rebellious be probably a real personality and have much in pron1   pron1 be 
at any rate a healthy protest   as for the virtuous poor one can pity 
pron1 of course but pron1 can not possibly admire pron1   pron1 have make 
private term with the enemy and sell pron1 birthright for very bad 
pottage   pron1 must also be extraordinarily stupid   pron1 can quite 
understand a man accept law pron1 protect private property and admit 
of pron1 accumulation as long as pron1 pron1 be able under those condition 
to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life   but pron1 be 
almost incredible to pron1 how a man whose life be mar and make hideous 
by such law can possibly acquiesce in pron1 continuance 

however the explanation be not really difficult to find   pron1 be simply 
this   misery and poverty be so absolutely degrading and exercise such 
a paralysing effect over the nature of man pron1 no class be ever really 
conscious of pron1 own suffering   pron1 have to be tell of pron1 by other 
people and pron1 often entirely disbelieve pron1   pron1 be say by great 
employer of labour against agitator be unquestionably true   agitator 
be a set of interfere meddle people pron1 come down to some 
perfectly content class of the community and sow the seed of 
discontent amongst pron1   that be the reason why agitator be so 
absolutely necessary   without pron1 in pron1 incomplete state pron1 would 
be no advance towards civilisation   person1 be put down in person1 not 
in consequence of any action on the part of the slave or even any 
express desire on pron1 part that pron1 should be free   pron1 be put down 
entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitator in 
person1 and elsewhere pron1 be not slave pron1 nor owner of 
slave nor have pron1 to do with the question really   pron1 be 
undoubtedly the abolitionist pron1 set the torch alight pron1 begin the 
whole thing   and pron1 be curious to note that from the slave pron1 
pron1 receive not merely very little assistance but hardly any sympathy 
even   and when at the close of the war the slave find pron1 free 
find pron1 indeed so absolutely free that pron1 be free to starve 
many of pron1 bitterly regret the new state of thing   to the thinker 
the most tragic fact in the whole of the french revolution be not that 
person1 person1 be kill for be a queen but that the starve 
peasant of the vendée voluntarily go out to die for the hideous cause 
of feudalism 

pron1 be clear then that no authoritarian socialism will do   for while 
under the present system a very large number of people can lead life of 
a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness under an 
industrial barrack system or a system of economic tyranny pron1 would 
be able to have any such freedom at all   pron1 be to be regret that a 
portion of pron1 community should be practically in slavery but to propose 
to solve the problem by enslave the entire community be childish 
every man must be leave quite free to choose pron1 own work   no form of 
compulsion must be exercise over pron1   if pron1 be pron1 work will not be 
good for pron1 will not be good in pron1 and will not be good for 
other   and by work pron1 simply mean activity of any kind 

pron1 hardly think that any socialist nowadays would seriously propose that 
an inspector should call every morning at each house to see that each 
person1 rise up and do manual labour for ordinal1 hour   person1 have get 
beyond that stage and reserve such a form of life for the people pron1 
in a very arbitrary manner pron1 choose to call criminal   but pron1 confess 
that many of the socialistic view pron1 pron1 have come across seem to pron1 to 
be taint with idea of authority if not of actual compulsion   of 
course authority and compulsion be out of the question   all 
association must be quite voluntary   pron1 be only in voluntary 
association that man be fine 

but pron1 may be ask how individualism which be now more or less 
dependent on the existence of private property for pron1 development will 
benefit by the abolition of such private property   the answer be very 
simple   pron1 be true that under exist condition a few man pron1 have 
have private mean of pron1 own such as person1 person1 person1 person1 
person1 baudelaire and other have be able to realise pron1 personality 
more or less completely   not ordinal1 of these man ever do a single day be 
work for hire   pron1 be relieve from poverty   pron1 have an immense 
advantage   the question be whether pron1 would be for the good of 
individualism that such an advantage should be take away   let pron1 
suppose that pron1 be take away   pron1 happen then to individualism   how 
will pron1 benefit 

pron1 will benefit in this way   under the new condition individualism will 
be far freer far fine and far more intensified than pron1 be now   pron1 be 
not talk of the great imaginatively realise individualism of such 
poet as pron1 have mention but of the great actual individualism latent 
and potential in mankind generally   for the recognition of private 
property have really harm individualism and obscure pron1 by confuse a 
man with pron1 pron1 possess   pron1 have lead individualism entirely astray 
pron1 have make gain not growth pron1 aim   so that man think that the 
important thing be to have and do not know that the important thing be 
to be   the true perfection of man lie not in pron1 man have but in pron1 
man be   private property have crush true individualism and set up an 
individualism pron1 be false   pron1 have debar ordinal1 part of the community 
from be individual by starve pron1   pron1 have debar the other part 
of the community from be individual by put pron1 on the wrong road 
and encumber pron1   indeed so completely have man be personality be 
absorb by pron1 possession that the english law have always treat 
offence against a man be property with far more severity than offence 
against pron1 person and property be still the test of complete 
citizenship   the industry necessary for the make money be also very 
person1   in a community like our where property confer immense 
distinction social position honour respect title and other pleasant 
thing of the kind man be naturally ambitious make pron1 pron1 aim to 
accumulate this property and go on wearily and tediously accumulate 
pron1 long after pron1 have get far more than pron1 want or can use or enjoy or 
perhaps even know of   person1 will kill pron1 by overwork in order to 
secure property and really consider the enormous advantage pron1 
property bring ordinal1 be hardly surprised   ordinal1 be regret be that society 
should be construct on such a basis pron1 man have be force into a 
groove in which pron1 can not freely develop pron1 be wonderful and 
fascinating and delightful in pron1 in which in fact pron1 miss the true 
pleasure and joy of living   pron1 be also under exist condition very 
insecure   an enormously wealthy merchant may be often be at every moment 
of pron1 life at the mercy of thing pron1 be not under pron1 control   if 
the wind blow an extra point or so or the weather suddenly change or 
some trivial thing happen pron1 ship may go down pron1 speculation may go 
wrong and pron1 find pron1 a poor man with pron1 social position quite 
gone   now pron1 should be able to harm a man except pron1   pron1 
should be able to rob a man at all   pron1 a man really have be pron1 be in 
pron1   pron1 be outside of pron1 should be a matter of no importance 

with the abolition of private property then pron1 shall have true 
beautiful healthy individualism   pron1 will waste pron1 life in 
accumulate thing and the symbol for thing   pron1 will live   to live 
be the rare thing in the world   most people exist that be all 

pron1 be a question whether pron1 have ever see the full expression of a 
personality except on the imaginative plane of art   in action pron1 never 
have   person1 say person1 be the complete and perfect man   but how 
tragically insecure be person1   wherever pron1 be a man pron1 exercise 
authority pron1 be a man pron1 resist authority   person1 be very perfect 
but pron1 perfection travel by too dangerous a road   person1 aurelius 
be the perfect man say person1   yes   the great emperor be a perfect 
man   but how intolerable be the endless claim upon pron1   pron1 stagger 
under the burden of the empire   pron1 be conscious how inadequate ordinal1 man 
be to bear the weight of that titan and too vast orb   pron1 pron1 mean by a 
person1 man be ordinal1 pron1 develop under perfect condition   ordinal1 pron1 be not 
wound or worry or maim or in danger   most personality have 
be oblige to be rebel   half pron1 strength have be waste in 
friction   person1 be personality for instance be terribly waste in pron1 
battle with the stupidity and hypocrisy and philistinism of the 
person1   such battle do not always intensify strength pron1 often 
exaggerate weakness   person1 be never able to give pron1 pron1 pron1 might have 
give pron1   person1 escape well   like person1 pron1 get out of person1 as 
soon as possible   but pron1 be not so well known   if the person1 have have 
any idea of pron1 a great poet pron1 really be pron1 would have fall on 
pron1 with tooth and nail and make pron1 life as unbearable to pron1 as pron1 
possibly could   but pron1 be not a remarkable figure in society and 
consequently pron1 escape to a certain degree   still even in shelley the 
note of rebellion be sometimes too strong   the note of the perfect 
personality be not rebellion but peace 

pron1 will be a marvellous thing the true personality of man when pron1 see pron1 
pron1 will grow naturally and simply flowerlike or as a tree grow   pron1 
will not be at discord   pron1 will never argue or dispute   pron1 will not 
prove thing   pron1 will know pron1   and yet pron1 will not busy pron1 
about knowledge   pron1 will have wisdom   pron1 value will not be measure by 
material thing   pron1 will have pron1   and yet pron1 will have pron1 
and whatever one take from pron1 pron1 will still have so rich will pron1 be 
pron1 will not be always meddle with other or ask pron1 to be like 
pron1   pron1 will love pron1 because pron1 will be different   and yet while 
pron1 will not meddle with other pron1 will help all as a beautiful thing 
help pron1 by be pron1 pron1 be   the personality of man will be very 
wonderful   pron1 will be as wonderful as the personality of a child 

in pron1 development pron1 will be assist by person1 if man desire 
that   but if man do not desire that pron1 will develop none the less 
surely   for pron1 will not worry pron1 about the past nor care whether 
thing happen or do not happen   nor will pron1 admit any law but pron1 
own law   nor any authority but pron1 own authority   yet pron1 will love 
those pron1 seek to intensify pron1 and speak often of pron1   and of these 
person1 be ordinal1 

  know pron1 be write over the portal of the antique world   over 
the portal of the new world be pron1 shall be write   and the 
message of person1 to man be simply be pron1   that be the secret of 
person1 

when person1 talk about the poor pron1 simply mean personality just as 
when pron1 talk about the rich pron1 simply mean people pron1 have not 
develop pron1 personality   person1 move in a community pron1 allow 
the accumulation of private property just as pron1 do and the gospel 
that pron1 preach be not that in such a community pron1 be an advantage for 
a man to live on scanty unwholesome food to wear ragged unwholesome 
clothe to sleep in horrid unwholesome dwelling and a disadvantage 
for a man to live under healthy pleasant and decent condition   such a 
view would have be wrong there and then and would of course be still 
more wrong now and in person1   for as man move northward the material 
necessity of life become of more vital importance and pron1 society be 
infinitely more complex and display far great extreme of luxury and 
person1 than any society of the antique world   pron1 person1 mean be 
this   pron1 say to man pron1 have a wonderful personality   develop pron1 
be pron1   do not imagine that pron1 perfection lie in accumulate or 
possess external thing   pron1 affection be inside of pron1   if only 
pron1 could realise that pron1 would not want to be rich   ordinary rich 
can be steal from a man   real rich can not   in the person1 house of 
pron1 soul pron1 be infinitely precious thing pron1 may not be take 
from pron1   and so try to so shape pron1 life that external thing will 
not harm pron1   and try also to get rid of personal property   pron1 involve 
sordid preoccupation endless industry continual wrong   personal 
property hinder individualism at every step   pron1 be to be note that 
person1 never say that impoverished people be necessarily good or 
wealthy people necessarily bad   that would not have be true   person1 
people be as a class well than impoverished people more moral more 
intellectual more well behave   pron1 be only ordinal1 class in the 
community pron1 think more about money than the rich and that be the 
poor   the poor can think of pron1 else   that be the misery of be 
poor   pron1 person1 do say be that man reach pron1 perfection not 
through pron1 pron1 have not even through pron1 pron1 do but entirely through 
pron1 pron1 be   and so the wealthy young man pron1 come to person1 be 
represent as a thoroughly good citizen pron1 have break none of the law 
of pron1 state none of the commandment of pron1 religion   pron1 be quite 
respectable in the ordinary sense of that extraordinary word   person1 
say to pron1 pron1 should give up private property   pron1 hinder pron1 from 
realise pron1 perfection   pron1 be a drag upon pron1   pron1 be a burden   pron1 
personality do not need pron1   pron1 be within pron1 and not outside of pron1 
that pron1 will find pron1 pron1 really be and pron1 pron1 really want   to 
pron1 own friend pron1 say the same thing   pron1 tell pron1 to be pron1 
and not to be always worry about other thing   pron1 do other thing 
matter   person1 be complete in pron1   when pron1 go into the world the 
person1 will disagree with pron1   that be inevitable   the world hate 
individualism   but that be not to trouble pron1   pron1 be to be calm and 
self centred   if a man take pron1 cloak pron1 be to give pron1 pron1 
coat just to show that material thing be of no importance   if people 
abuse pron1 pron1 be not to answer back   pron1 do pron1 signify   the 
thing people say of a man do not alter a man   pron1 be pron1 pron1 be   public 
opinion be of no value whatsoever   even if people employ actual 
violence pron1 be not to be violent in turn   that would be to fall to 
the same low level   after all even in prison a man can be quite free 
pron1 soul can be free   pron1 personality can be untroubled   pron1 can be at 
peace   and above all thing pron1 be not to interfere with other 
people or judge pron1 in any way   personality be a very mysterious thing 
a man can not always be estimate by pron1 pron1 do   pron1 may keep the law 
and yet be worthless   pron1 may break the law and yet be fine   pron1 may be 
bad without ever do pron1 bad   pron1 may commit a sin against 
society and yet realise through that sin pron1 true perfection 

pron1 be a woman pron1 be take in adultery   pron1 be not tell the history 
of pron1 love but that love must have be very great   for person1 say that 
pron1 sin be forgive pron1 not because pron1 repent but because pron1 
love be so intense and wonderful   later on a short time before pron1 
death as pron1 sit at a feast the woman come in and pour costly perfume 
on pron1 hair   pron1 friend try to interfere with pron1 and say that pron1 
be an extravagance and that the money pron1 the perfume cost should have 
be expend on charitable relief of people in want or pron1 of 
that kind   person1 do not accept that view   pron1 point out that the 
material need of man be great and very permanent but that the 
spiritual need of man be great still and that in ordinal1 divine moment 
and by select pron1 own mode of expression a personality might make 
person1 perfect   the world worship the woman even now as a saint 

yes   pron1 be suggestive thing in individualism   socialism annihilate 
family life for instance   with the abolition of private property 
marriage in pron1 present form must disappear   this be part of the 
person1   individualism accept this and make pron1 fine   pron1 convert 
the abolition of legal restraint into a form of freedom pron1 will help 
the full development of personality and make the love of man and woman 
more wonderful more beautiful and more ennobling   person1 know this   pron1 
reject the claim of family life although pron1 exist in pron1 day and 
community in a very marked form   pron1 be pron1 mother   pron1 be pron1 
brother   pron1 say when pron1 be tell that pron1 wish to speak to pron1 
when ordinal1 of pron1 follower ask leave to go and bury pron1 father let the 
dead bury the dead be pron1 terrible answer   pron1 would allow no claim 
whatsoever to be make on personality 

and so pron1 pron1 would lead a christlike life be pron1 pron1 be perfectly and 
absolutely pron1   pron1 may be a great poet or a great man of science 
or a young student at a university or ordinal1 pron1 watch sheep upon a moor 
or a maker of drama like shakespeare or a thinker about person1 like 
person1   or a child pron1 play in a garden or a fisherman pron1 throw pron1 
net into the sea   pron1 do not matter pron1 pron1 be as long as pron1 realise 
the perfection of the soul pron1 be within pron1   all imitation in moral 
and in life be wrong   through the street of person1 at the present 
day crawl ordinal1 pron1 be mad and carry a wooden cross on pron1 shoulder 
pron1 be a symbol of the life pron1 be mar by imitation   person1 person1 
be christlike when pron1 go out to live with the leper because in such 
service pron1 realise fully pron1 be good in pron1   but pron1 be not more 
person1 than wagner when pron1 realise pron1 soul in music   or than 
person1 when pron1 realise pron1 soul in song   pron1 be no ordinal1 type for 
man   pron1 be as many perfection as pron1 be imperfect man   and 
while to the claim of charity a man may yield and yet be free to the 
claim of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all 

individualism then be pron1 through socialism pron1 be to attain to   as a 
natural result the state must give up all idea of government   pron1 must 
give pron1 up because as a wise man once say many century before person1 
pron1 be such a thing as leave mankind alone   pron1 be no such thing as 
govern mankind   all mode of government be failure   despotism be 
unjust to pron1 include the despot pron1 be probably make for 
well thing   oligarchy be unjust to the many and ochlocracy be 
unjust to the few   high hope be once form of democracy   but 
democracy mean simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for 
the people   pron1 have be find out   pron1 must say that pron1 be high time 
for all authority be quite degrading   pron1 degrade those pron1 exercise pron1 
and degrade those over pron1 pron1 be exercise   when pron1 be violently 
grossly and cruelly use pron1 produce a good effect by create or at 
any rate bring out the spirit of revolt and individualism pron1 be to 
kill pron1   when pron1 be use with a certain amount of kindness and 
accompany by prize and reward pron1 be dreadfully demoralise 
people in that case be less conscious of the horrible pressure pron1 be 
be put on pron1 and so go through pron1 life in a sort of coarse 
comfort like pet animal without ever realise that pron1 be 
probably think other people be thought live by other people be 
standard wear practically pron1 pron1 may call other people be 
second hand clothe and never be pron1 for a single moment   pron1 
pron1 would be free say a fine thinker person1 not conform   and 
authority by bribe people to conform produce a very gross kind of 
over fed barbarism amongst pron1 

with authority punishment will pass away   this will be a great gain a 
gain in fact of incalculable value   as ordinal1 read history not in the 
expurgate edition write for school boy and person1 but in the 
original authority of each time ordinal1 be absolutely sickened not by the 
crime that the wicked have commit but by the punishment pron1 the 
good have inflict   and a community be infinitely more brutalise by the 
habitual employment of punishment than pron1 be by the occurrence of crime 
pron1 obviously follow that the more punishment be inflict the more crime 
be produce and most modern legislation have clearly recognise this and 
have make pron1 pron1 task to diminish punishment as far as pron1 think pron1 can 
wherever pron1 have really diminish pron1 the result have always be 
extremely good   the less punishment the less crime   when pron1 be no 
punishment at all crime will either cease to exist or if pron1 occur 
will be treat by physician as a very distressing form of dementia to 
be cure by care and kindness   for pron1 be call criminal nowadays 
be not criminal at all   starvation and not sin be the parent of 
modern crime   that indeed be the reason why pron1 criminal be as a 
class so absolutely uninteresting from any psychological point of view 
pron1 be not marvellous macbeths and terrible vautrin   pron1 be merely 
pron1 ordinary respectable commonplace people would be if pron1 have not 
got enough to eat   when private property be abolish pron1 will be no 
necessity for crime no demand for pron1   pron1 will cease to exist   of 
course all crime be not crime against property though such be the 
crime that the english law value pron1 a man have more than pron1 a man 
be punishe with the harsh and most horrible severity if pron1 except 
the crime of murder and regard death as bad than penal servitude a 
point on which pron1 criminal pron1 believe disagree   but though a crime 
may not be against property pron1 may spring from the misery and rage and 
depression produce by pron1 wrong system of property holding and so when 
that system be abolish will disappear   when each member of the 
community have sufficient for pron1 want and be not interfere with by pron1 
neighbour pron1 will not be an object of any interest to pron1 to interfere 
with pron1 else   person1 which be an extraordinary source of crime in 
modern life be an emotion closely bind up with pron1 conception of 
property and under socialism and individualism will die out   pron1 be 
remarkable that in communistic tribe jealousy be entirely unknown 

now as the state be not to govern pron1 may be ask pron1 the state be to 
do   the state be to be a voluntary association pron1 will organise 
person1 and be the manufacturer and distributor of necessary commodity 
the state be to make pron1 be useful   the individual be to make pron1 be 
beautiful   and as pron1 have mention the word labour pron1 can not help say 
that a great deal of nonsense be be write and talk nowadays about 
the dignity of manual labour   pron1 be pron1 necessarily dignified 
about manual labour at all and most of pron1 be absolutely degrading   pron1 
be mentally and morally injurious to man to do pron1 in which pron1 do 
not find pleasure and many form of labour be quite pleasureless 
activity and should be regard as such   to sweep a slushy crossing 
for ordinal1 hour on a day when the east wind be blow be a disgusting 
occupation   to sweep pron1 with mental moral or physical dignity seem to 
pron1 to be impossible   to sweep pron1 with joy would be appalling   person1 be 
make for pron1 well than disturb dirt   all work of that kind 
should be do by a machine 

and pron1 have no doubt that pron1 will be so   up to the present man have be 
to a certain extent the slave of machinery and pron1 be pron1 
tragic in the fact that as soon as man have invent a machine to do pron1 
work pron1 begin to starve   this however be of course the result of pron1 
property system and pron1 system of competition   ordinal1 man own a machine 
which do the work of ordinal1 ordinal1 man   ordinal1 ordinal1 man be in 
consequence throw out of employment and have no work to do become 
hungry and take to thieving   the ordinal1 man secure the produce of the 
machine and keep pron1 and have ordinal1 ordinal1 time as much as pron1 should 
have and probably which be of much more importance a great deal more 
than pron1 really want   be that machine the property of all every one 
would benefit by pron1   pron1 would be an immense advantage to the community 
all unintellectual labour all monotonous dull labour all labour pron1 
deal with dreadful thing and involve unpleasant condition must be 
do by machinery   person1 must work for pron1 in coal mine and do all 
sanitary service and be the stoker of steamer and clean the street 
and run message on wet day and do pron1 pron1 be tedious or 
distressing   at present machinery compete against man   under proper 
condition machinery will serve man   pron1 be no doubt at all pron1 this 
be the future of machinery and just as tree grow while the country 
person1 be asleep so while humanity will be amusing pron1 or 
enjoy cultivated leisure which and not labour be the aim of man or 
make beautiful thing or read beautiful thing or simply 
contemplate the world with admiration and delight machinery will be 
do all the necessary and unpleasant work   the fact be that 
civilisation require slave   the person1 be quite right there   unless 
pron1 be slave to do the ugly horrible uninteresting work culture 
and contemplation become almost impossible   human slavery be wrong 
insecure and demoralising   on mechanical slavery on the slavery of the 
machine the future of the world depend   and when scientific man be no 
long call upon to go down to a depressing east end and distribute bad 
cocoa and bad blanket to starve people pron1 will have delightful 
leisure in which to devise wonderful and marvellous thing for pron1 own 
person1 and the joy of pron1 else   pron1 will be great storage of force 
for every city and for every house if require and this force man will 
convert into heat light or motion accord to pron1 need   be this 
utopian   a map of the world pron1 do not include utopia be not worth 
even glance at for pron1 leave out the ordinal1 country at which humanity be 
always land   and when humanity land there pron1 look out and see 
a well country set sail   person1 be the realisation of utopia 

now pron1 have say that the community by mean of organisation of machinery 
will supply the useful thing and that the beautiful thing will be make 
by the individual   this be not merely necessary but pron1 be the only 
possible way by which pron1 can get either the one or the other   an 
individual pron1 have to make thing for the use of other and with 
reference to pron1 want and pron1 wish do not work with interest 
and consequently can not put into pron1 work pron1 be good in pron1   upon the 
other hand whenever a community or a powerful section of a community or 
a government of any kind attempt to dictate to the artist pron1 pron1 be to 
do art either entirely vanish or become stereotyped or degenerate 
into a low and ignoble form of craft   a work of art be the unique result 
of a unique temperament   pron1 beauty come from the fact that the author 
be pron1 pron1 be   pron1 have pron1 to do with the fact that other people want 
pron1 pron1 want   indeed the moment that an artist take notice of pron1 
other people want and try to supply the demand pron1 cease to be an 
artist and become a dull or an amusing craftsman an honest or a 
dishonest tradesman   pron1 have no further claim to be consider as an 
artist   art be the most intense mode of individualism pron1 the world have 
know   pron1 be inclined to say that pron1 be the only real mode of 
individualism pron1 the world have know   crime which under certain 
condition may seem to have create individualism must take cognisance 
of other people and interfere with pron1   pron1 belong to the sphere of 
action   but alone without any reference to pron1 neighbour without any 
interference the artist can fashion a beautiful thing   and if pron1 do 
not do pron1 solely for pron1 own pleasure pron1 be not an artist at all 

and pron1 be to be note that pron1 be the fact that art be this intense form 
of individualism pron1 make the public try to exercise over pron1 in an 
authority pron1 be as immoral as pron1 be ridiculous and as corrupt as pron1 
be contemptible   pron1 be not quite pron1 fault   the public have always 
and in every age be badly bring up   pron1 be continually ask art 
to be popular to please pron1 want of taste to flatter pron1 absurd 
vanity to tell pron1 pron1 pron1 have be tell before to show pron1 pron1 
pron1 ought to be tired of see to amuse pron1 when pron1 feel heavy 
after eat too much and to distract pron1 thought when pron1 be 
person1 of pron1 own stupidity   now art should never try to be popular 
the public should try to make pron1 artistic   pron1 be a very wide 
difference   if a man of science be tell that the result of pron1 
experiment and the conclusion that pron1 arrive at should be of such a 
character that pron1 would not upset the receive popular notion on the 
subject or disturb popular prejudice or hurt the sensibility of 
people pron1 know pron1 about science   if a philosopher be tell that pron1 
have a perfect right to speculate in the high sphere of thought 
provide that pron1 arrive at the same conclusion as be hold by those 
pron1 have never think in any sphere at all well nowadays the man of 
science and the philosopher would be considerably amused   yet pron1 be 
really a very few year since both philosophy and science be subject 
to brutal popular control to authority in fact the authority of either 
the general ignorance of the community or the terror and greed for power 
of an ecclesiastical or governmental class   of course pron1 have to a very 
great extent get rid of any attempt on the part of the community or the 
church or the government to interfere with the individualism of 
speculative think but the attempt to interfere with the individualism 
of imaginative art still linger   in fact pron1 do more than linger   pron1 
be aggressive offensive and brutalise 

in person1 the art pron1 have escape well be the art in which the 
public take no interest   person1 be an instance of pron1 pron1 mean   pron1 have 
be able to have fine poetry in person1 because the public do not read 
pron1 and consequently do not influence pron1   the public like to insult 
poet because pron1 be individual but once pron1 have insult pron1 pron1 
leave pron1 alone   in the case of the novel and the drama art in which 
the public do take an interest the result of the exercise of popular 
person1 have be absolutely ridiculous   no country produce such 
badly write fiction such tedious common work in the novel form such 
silly vulgar play as person1   pron1 must necessarily be so   the popular 
person1 be of such a character pron1 no artist can get to pron1   pron1 be at 
once too easy and too difficult to be a popular novelist   pron1 be too 
easy because the requirement of the public as far as plot style 
psychology treatment of life and treatment of literature be concern 
be within the reach of the very mean capacity and the most 
uncultivated mind   pron1 be too difficult because to meet such 
requirement the artist would have to do violence to pron1 temperament 
would have to write not for the artistic joy of writing but for the 
amusement of half educate people and so would have to suppress pron1 
individualism forget pron1 culture annihilate pron1 style and surrender 
pron1 pron1 be valuable in pron1   in the case of the drama thing be 
a little well the theatre go public like the obvious pron1 be true 
but pron1 do not like the tedious   and burlesque and farcical comedy the 
ordinal1 most popular form be distinct form of art   delightful work may 
be produce under burlesque and farcical condition and in work of this 
kind the artist in person1 be allow very great freedom   pron1 be when ordinal1 
come to the high form of the drama pron1 the result of popular control 
be see   the ordinal1 thing pron1 the public dislike be novelty   any attempt 
to extend the subject matter of art be extremely distasteful to the 
public   and yet the vitality and progress of art depend in a large 
measure on the continual extension of subject matter   the public dislike 
novelty because pron1 be afraid of pron1   pron1 represent to pron1 a mode of 
individualism an assertion on the part of the artist pron1 pron1 select pron1 
own subject and treat pron1 as pron1 choose   the public be quite right in 
pron1 attitude   art be individualism and individualism be a disturbing 
and disintegrate force   therein lie pron1 immense value   for pron1 pron1 
seek to disturb be monotony of type slavery of custom tyranny of 
habit and the reduction of man to the level of a machine   in art the 
public accept pron1 have be because pron1 can not alter pron1 not because 
pron1 appreciate pron1   pron1 swallow pron1 classic whole and never taste 
pron1   pron1 endure pron1 as the inevitable and as pron1 can not mar pron1 
pron1 mouth about pron1   strangely enough or not strangely accord to 
ordinal1 be own view this acceptance of the classic do a great deal of 
harm   the uncritical admiration of the bible and person1 in person1 
be an instance of pron1 pron1 mean   with regard to the person1 consideration 
of ecclesiastical authority enter into the matter so that pron1 need not 
dwell upon the point 

but in the case of shakespeare pron1 be quite obvious that the public really 
see neither the beauty nor the defect of pron1 play   if pron1 see the 
beauty pron1 would not object to the development of the drama   and if 
pron1 see the defect pron1 would not object to the development of the 
drama either   the fact be the public make use of the classic of a 
country as a means of check the progress of art   pron1 degrade the 
classic into authority   pron1 use pron1 as bludgeon for prevent the 
free expression of beauty in new form   pron1 be always ask a writer 
why pron1 do not write like pron1 else or a painter why pron1 do not 
paint like pron1 else quite oblivious of the fact that if either of 
pron1 do pron1 of the kind pron1 would cease to be an artist   a fresh 
mode of beauty be absolutely distasteful to pron1 and whenever pron1 appear 
pron1 get so angry and bewilder that pron1 always use ordinal1 stupid 
expression ordinal1 be that the work of art be grossly unintelligible   the 
other that the work of art be grossly immoral   pron1 pron1 mean by these 
word seem to pron1 to be this   when pron1 say a work be grossly 
unintelligible pron1 mean that the artist have say or make a beautiful 
thing pron1 be new   when pron1 describe a work as grossly immoral pron1 
mean that the artist have say or make a beautiful thing pron1 be true 
the former expression have reference to style   the latter to 
subject matter   but pron1 probably use the word very vaguely as an 
ordinary mob will use ready make pave stone   pron1 be not a single 
real poet or prose writer of this century for instance on pron1 the 
british public have not solemnly confer diploma of immorality and 
these diploma practically take the place with pron1 of pron1 in person1 be 
the formal recognition of an academy of letter and fortunately make the 
establishment of such an institution quite unnecessary in person1   of 
course the public be very reckless in pron1 use of the word   that pron1 
should have call wordsworth an immoral poet be only to be expect 
person1 be a poet   but that pron1 should have call person1 person1 
an immoral novelist be extraordinary   person1 be prose be not of a very 
fine quality   still pron1 be the word and pron1 use pron1 as well pron1 
can   an artist be of course not disturb by pron1   the true artist be a 
man pron1 believe absolutely in pron1 because pron1 be absolutely pron1 
but pron1 can fancy that if an artist produce a work of art in person1 that 
immediately on pron1 appearance be recognise by the public through pron1 
medium which be the public press as a work pron1 be quite intelligible 
and highly moral pron1 would begin to seriously question whether in pron1 
creation pron1 have really be pron1 at all and consequently whether the 
work be not quite unworthy of pron1 and either of a thoroughly 
second rate order or of no artistic value whatsoever 

perhaps however pron1 have wrong the public in limit pron1 to such 
word as immoral unintelligible exotic and unhealthy   there 
be ordinal1 other word pron1 pron1 use   that word be amorbid   pron1 do not use 
pron1 often   the meaning of the word be so simple that pron1 be afraid of 
use pron1   still pron1 use pron1 sometimes and now and then ordinal1 come 
across pron1 in popular newspaper   pron1 be of course a ridiculous word to 
apply to a work of art   for pron1 be morbidity but a mood of emotion or a 
mode of thought that pron1 can not express   the public be all morbid 
because the public can never find expression for pron1   the artist be 
never morbid   pron1 express pron1   pron1 stand outside pron1 subject 
and through pron1 medium produce incomparable and artistic effect   to 
call an artist morbid because pron1 deal with morbidity as pron1 
subject matter be as silly as if ordinal1 call shakespeare mad because pron1 
write king lear   

on the whole an artist in person1 gain pron1 by be attack 
pron1 individuality be intensify   pron1 become more completely pron1 
of course the attack be very gross very impertinent and very 
person1   but then no artist expect grace from the vulgar mind or 
style from the suburban intellect   vulgarity and stupidity be ordinal1 very 
vivid fact in modern life   ordinal1 regret pron1 naturally   but there pron1 
be   pron1 be subject for study like pron1 else   and pron1 be only 
fair to state with regard to modern journalist that pron1 always 
apologise to ordinal1 in private for pron1 pron1 have write against ordinal1 in 
public 

within the last few year ordinal1 other adjective pron1 may be mention have 
be add to the very limited vocabulary of art abuse pron1 be at the 
disposal of the public   ordinal1 be the word unhealthy the other be the 
person1 exotic   the latter merely express the rage of the momentary 
mushroom against the immortal entrance and exquisitely lovely orchid 
pron1 be a tribute but a tribute of no importance   the word unhealthy 
however admit of analysis   pron1 be a rather interesting word   in fact 
pron1 be so interesting that the people pron1 use pron1 do not know pron1 pron1 
mean 

pron1 do pron1 mean   pron1 be a healthy or an unhealthy work of art   all 
term that pron1 apply to a work of art provide that pron1 apply pron1 
rationally have reference to either pron1 style or pron1 subject or to both 
together   from the point of view of style a healthy work of art be ordinal1 
whose style recognise the beauty of the material pron1 employ be that 
material ordinal1 of word or of bronze of colour or of ivory and use that 
beauty as a factor in produce the æsthetic effect   from the point of 
view of subject a healthy work of art be ordinal1 the choice of whose subject 
be condition by the temperament of the artist and come directly out 
of pron1   in fine a healthy work of art be ordinal1 pron1 have both perfection 
and personality   of course form and substance can not be separate in a 
work of art   pron1 be always ordinal1   but for purpose of analysis and 
set the wholeness of æsthetic impression aside for a moment pron1 can 
intellectually so separate pron1   an unhealthy work of art on the other 
hand be a work whose style be obvious old fashioned and common and 
whose subject be deliberately choose not because the artist have any 
pleasure in pron1 but because pron1 think that the public will pay pron1 for 
pron1   in fact the popular novel that the public call healthy be always a 
thoroughly unhealthy production   and pron1 the public call an unhealthy 
person1 be always a beautiful and healthy work of art 

pron1 need hardly say that pron1 be not for a single moment complain that 
the public and the public press misuse these word   pron1 do not see how 
with pron1 lack of comprehension of pron1 art be pron1 could possibly use 
pron1 in the proper sense   pron1 be merely point out the misuse   and as 
for the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lie behind pron1 all the 
explanation be very simple   pron1 come from the barbarous conception of 
person1   pron1 come from the natural inability of a community corrupt 
by authority to understand or appreciate individualism   in a word pron1 
come from that monstrous and ignorant thing pron1 be call public 
opinion which bad and well meaning as pron1 be when pron1 try to control 
action be infamous and of evil meaning when pron1 try to control think 
or art 

indeed pron1 be much more to be say in favour of the physical force of 
the public than pron1 be in favour of the public be opinion   the former 
may be fine   the latter must be foolish   pron1 be often say that force be 
no argument   that however entirely depend on pron1 one want to prove 
many of the most important problem of the last few century such as 
the continuance of personal government in person1 or of feudalism in 
person1 have be solve entirely by mean of physical force   the very 
violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a 
moment   pron1 be a fatal day when the public discover that the pen be 
mightier than the pave stone and can be make as offensive as the 
person1   pron1 at once seek for the journalist find pron1 develop 
pron1 and make pron1 pron1 industrious and well pay servant   pron1 be greatly 
to be regret for both pron1 sake   behind the barricade pron1 may be 
much pron1 be noble and heroic   but pron1 be there behind the 
lead article but prejudice stupidity can not and twaddle   and when 
these ordinal1 be join together pron1 make a terrible force and constitute 
the new authority 

in old day man have the rack   now pron1 have the press   that be an 
improvement certainly   but still pron1 be very bad and wrong and 
person1   pron1 be pron1 person1   call journalism the fourth 
estate   that be true at the time no doubt   but at the present moment 
pron1 really be the only estate   pron1 have eat up the other ordinal1   the 
lord temporal say pron1 the lord spiritual have pron1 to say and 
the house of person1 have pron1 to say and say pron1   pron1 be dominate by 
journalism   in person1 the person1 reign for ordinal1 year and 
journalism govern for ever and ever   fortunately in person1 person1 
have carry pron1 authority to the gross and most brutal extreme   as a 
natural consequence pron1 have begin to create a spirit of revolt   people 
be amuse by pron1 or disgust by pron1 accord to pron1 temperament 
but pron1 be no long the real force pron1 be   pron1 be not seriously treat 
in person1 person1 not except in a few well know instance have 
be carry to such excess of brutality be still a great factor a 
really remarkable power   the tyranny pron1 pron1 propose to exercise over 
people be private life seem to pron1 to be quite extraordinary   the fact 
be that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know pron1 
except pron1 be worth know   person1 conscious of this and have 
tradesman like habit supply pron1 demand   in century before our 
the public nail the ear of journalist to the pump   that be quite 
hideous   in this century journalist have nail pron1 own ear to the 
keyhole   that be much bad   and pron1 aggravate the mischief be that 
the journalist pron1 be most to blame be not the amusing journalist pron1 
write for pron1 be call society paper   the harm be do by the 
serious thoughtful earnest journalist pron1 solemnly as pron1 be do 
at present will drag before the eye of the public some incident in the 
private life of a great statesman of a man pron1 be a leader of political 
thought as pron1 be a creator of political force and invite the public to 
discuss the incident to exercise authority in the matter to give pron1 
view and not merely to give pron1 view but to carry pron1 into action 
to dictate to the man upon all other point to dictate to pron1 party to 
dictate to pron1 country   in fact to make pron1 ridiculous 
offensive and harmful   the private life of man and woman should not be 
tell to the public   the public have pron1 to do with pron1 at all   in 
person1 pron1 manage these thing well   there pron1 do not allow the 
detail of the trial pron1 take place in the divorce court to be 
publish for the amusement or criticism of the public   all pron1 the 
public be allow to know be that the divorce have take place and be 
grant on petition of ordinal1 or other or both of the married party 
concerned   in person1 in fact pron1 limit the journalist and allow the 
artist almost perfect freedom   here pron1 allow absolute freedom to the 
journalist and entirely limit the artist   english public opinion that 
be to say try to constrain and impede and warp the man pron1 make 
thing pron1 be beautiful in effect and compel the journalist to retail 
thing pron1 be ugly or disgusting or revolt in fact so that pron1 
have the most serious journalist in the world and the most indecent 
newspaper   pron1 be no exaggeration to talk of compulsion   pron1 be 
possibly some journalist pron1 take a real pleasure in publish horrible 
thing or pron1 be poor look to scandal as form a sort of 
permanent basis for an income   but pron1 be other journalist pron1 feel 
certain man of education and cultivation pron1 really dislike publishing 
these thing pron1 know that pron1 be wrong to do so and only do pron1 because 
the unhealthy condition under which pron1 occupation be carry on 
oblige pron1 to supply the public with pron1 the public want and to 
compete with other journalist in make that supply as full and 
satisfy to the gross popular appetite as possible   pron1 be a very 
degrade position for any body of educate man to be place in and pron1 
have no doubt that most of pron1 feel pron1 acutely 

however let pron1 leave pron1 be really a very sordid side of the subject 
and return to the question of popular control in the matter of art by 
which pron1 mean public opinion dictate to the artist the form which pron1 be 
to use the mode in which pron1 be to use pron1 and the material with which 
pron1 be to work   pron1 have point out that the art which have escape well 
in person1 be the art in which the public have not be interested 
pron1 be however interested in the drama and as a certain advance have 
be make in the drama within the last ordinal1 or ordinal1 year pron1 be 
important to point out that this advance be entirely due to a few 
individual artist refuse to accept the popular want of taste as pron1 
person1 and refuse to regard art as a mere matter of demand and 
supply   with pron1 marvellous and vivid personality with a style pron1 have 
really a true colour element in pron1 with pron1 extraordinary power not 
over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation person1 
person1 have pron1 sole object be to give the public pron1 pron1 want 
could have produce the common play in the commonest manner and make 
as much success and money as a man could possibly desire   but pron1 object 
be not that   pron1 object be to realise pron1 own perfection as an artist 
under certain condition and in certain form of art   at first pron1 
appeal to the few now pron1 have educate the many   pron1 have create in the 
public both taste and temperament   the public appreciate pron1 artistic 
success immensely   pron1 often wonder however whether the public 
understand that that success be entirely due to the fact that pron1 do not 
accept pron1 standard but realise pron1 own   with pron1 standard the 
lyceum would have be a sort of second rate booth as some of the 
popular theatre in person1 be at present   whether pron1 understand pron1 or 
not the fact however remain that taste and temperament have to a 
certain extent be create in the public and that the public be capable 
of develop these quality   the problem then be why do not the 
public become more civilised   pron1 have the capacity   pron1 stop pron1 

the thing pron1 stop pron1 pron1 must be say again be pron1 desire to 
exercise authority over the artist and over work of art   to certain 
theatre such as the lyceum and the haymarket the public seem to come 
in a proper mood   in both of these theatre there have be individual 
artist pron1 have succeed in create in pron1 audience and every 
person1 in person1 have pron1 own audience the temperament to which art 
appeal   and pron1 be that temperament   pron1 be the temperament of 
person1   that be all 

if a man approach a work of art with any desire to exercise authority 
over pron1 and the artist pron1 approach pron1 in such a spirit pron1 pron1 can not 
receive any artistic impression from pron1 at all   the work of art be to 
dominate the spectator the spectator be not to dominate the work of art 
the spectator be to be receptive   pron1 be to be the violin on which the 
person1 be to play   and the more completely pron1 can suppress pron1 own silly 
view pron1 own foolish prejudice pron1 own absurd idea of pron1 art 
should be or should not be the more likely pron1 be to understand and 
appreciate the work of art in question   this be of course quite 
obvious in the case of the vulgar theatre go public of english man and 
woman   but pron1 be equally true of pron1 be call educate people   for 
an educated person be idea of art be draw naturally from pron1 art have 
be whereas the new work of art be beautiful by be pron1 art have 
never be   and to measure pron1 by the standard of the past be to measure 
pron1 by a standard on the rejection of which pron1 real perfection depend 
a temperament capable of receive through an imaginative medium and 
under imaginative condition new and beautiful impression be the only 
temperament pron1 can appreciate a work of art   and true as this be in 
the case of the appreciation of sculpture and paint pron1 be still more 
true of the appreciation of such art as the drama   for a picture and a 
statue be not at war with time   pron1 take no count of pron1 succession 
in ordinal1 moment pron1 unity may be apprehend   in the case of literature 
pron1 be different   person1 must be traverse before the unity of effect be 
realise   and so in the drama pron1 may occur in the first act of the 
play pron1 whose real artistic value may not be evident to the 
spectator till the third or fourth act be reach   be the silly fellow 
to get angry and call out and disturb the play and annoy the artist 
no   the honest man be to sit quietly and know the delightful emotion 
of wonder curiosity and suspense   pron1 be not to go to the play to lose 
a vulgar temper   pron1 be to go to the play to realise an artistic 
temperament   pron1 be to go to the play to gain an artistic temperament 
pron1 be not the arbiter of the work of art   pron1 be ordinal1 pron1 be admit to 
contemplate the work of art and if the work be fine to forget in pron1 
contemplation and the egotism pron1 person1 pron1 the egotism of pron1 ignorance 
or the egotism of pron1 information   this point about the drama be hardly 
pron1 think sufficiently recognise   pron1 can quite understand pron1 be 
  person1 produce for the first time before a modern person1 audience 
many of the people present would strongly and vigorously object to the 
introduction of the witch in the first act with pron1 grotesque 
phrase and pron1 ridiculous word   but when the play be over ordinal1 
realise that the laughter of the witch in person1 be as terrible as 
the laughter of madness in lear more terrible than the laughter of 
person1 in the tragedy of the moor   no spectator of art need a more 
perfect mood of receptivity than the spectator of a play   the moment pron1 
seek to exercise authority pron1 become the avowed enemy of art and of 
pron1   art do not mind   pron1 be pron1 pron1 suffer 

with the novel pron1 be the same thing   popular authority and the 
recognition of popular authority be fatal   person1 be esmond be a 
beautiful work of art because pron1 write pron1 to please pron1   in pron1 
other novel in person1 in person1 in vanity fair even at 
time pron1 be too conscious of the public and spoil pron1 work by 
appeal directly to the sympathy of the public or by directly 
mock at pron1   a true artist take no notice whatever of the public 
the public be to pron1 non existent   pron1 have no poppied or honeyed cake 
through which to give the monster sleep or sustenance   pron1 leave that to 
the popular novelist   ordinal1 incomparable novelist pron1 have now in person1 
person1 person1 person1   pron1 be well artist in person1 but person1 have 
no one whose view of life be so large so varied so imaginatively true 
pron1 be teller of story in person1 pron1 have a more vivid sense of 
what pain in fiction may be   but to pron1 belong philosophy in fiction 
pron1 people not merely live but pron1 live in thought   pron1 can see pron1 
from myriad point of view   pron1 be suggestive   pron1 be soul in pron1 
and around pron1   pron1 be interpretative and symbolic   and pron1 pron1 make 
pron1 those wonderful quickly move figure make pron1 for pron1 own 
pleasure and have never ask the public pron1 pron1 want have never 
care to know pron1 pron1 want have never allow the public to dictate 
to pron1 or influence pron1 in any way but have go on intensify pron1 own 
personality and produce pron1 own individual work   at first none come 
to pron1   that do not matter   then the few come to pron1   that do not 
change pron1   the many have come now   pron1 be still the same   pron1 be an 
incomparable novelist 

with the decorative art pron1 be not different   the public cling with 
really pathetic tenacity to pron1 pron1 believe be the direct tradition of 
the great exhibition of international vulgarity tradition pron1 be so 
appal that the house in which people live be only fit for blind 
people to live in   beautiful thing begin to be make beautiful colour 
come from the dyer be hand beautiful pattern from the artist be brain 
and the use of beautiful thing and pron1 value and importance be set 
forth   the public be really very indignant   pron1 lose pron1 temper 
pron1 say silly thing   no ordinal1 minded   no one be a whit the bad   no 
ordinal1 accept the authority of public opinion   and now pron1 be almost 
impossible to enter any modern house without see some recognition of 
good taste some recognition of the value of lovely surrounding some 
sign of appreciation of beauty   in fact people be house be as a rule 
quite charming nowadays   people have be to a very great extent 
civilised   pron1 be only fair to state however that the extraordinary 
success of the revolution in house decoration and furniture and the like 
have not really be due to the majority of the public develop a very 
fine taste in such matter   pron1 have be chiefly due to the fact that the 
craftsman of thing so appreciate the pleasure of make pron1 be 
beautiful and wake to such a vivid consciousness of the hideousness and 
vulgarity of pron1 the public have previously want that pron1 simply 
starve the public out   pron1 would be quite impossible at the present 
moment to furnish a room as room be furnish a few year ago without 
go for pron1 to an auction of second hand furniture from some 
third rate lodging house   the thing be no long make   however pron1 
may object to pron1 people must nowadays have pron1 charming in pron1 
surrounding   fortunately for pron1 pron1 assumption of authority in 
these art matter come to entire grief 

pron1 be evident then that all authority in such thing be bad   people 
sometimes inquire what form of government be most suitable for an artist 
to live under   to this question pron1 be only ordinal1 answer   the form of 
government pron1 be most suitable to the artist be no government at all 
authority over pron1 and pron1 art be ridiculous   pron1 have be state that 
under despotism artist have produce lovely work   this be not quite 
so   artist have visit despot not as subject to be tyrannise over 
but as wander wonder maker as fascinating vagrant personality to 
be entertained and charm and suffer to be at peace and allow to 
create   pron1 be this to be say in favour of the despot that pron1 be 
an individual may have culture while the mob be a monster have 
none   ordinal1 pron1 be an emperor and king may stoop down to pick up a brush 
for a painter but when the democracy stoop down pron1 be merely to throw 
mud   and yet the democracy have not so far to stoop as the emperor   in 
fact when pron1 want to throw mud pron1 have not to stoop at all   but 
pron1 be no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob   all authority 
be equally bad 

pron1 be ordinal1 kind of despot   pron1 be the despot pron1 tyrannise 
over the body   pron1 be the despot pron1 tyrannise over the soul   there 
be the despot pron1 tyrannise over the soul and body alike   the first be 
call the prince   the second be call the pope   the third be call 
the people   the prince may be cultivate   many prince have be   yet 
in the prince pron1 be danger   ordinal1 think of person1 at the bitter feast 
in verona of person1 in person1 be madman be cell   pron1 be well for the 
artist not to live with prince   the pope may be cultivate   many pope 
have be   the bad pope have be   the bad pope love beauty almost 
as passionately nay with as much passion as the good pope hate 
thought   to the wickedness of the person1 person1 owe much   the 
goodness of the person1 owe a terrible debt to humanity   yet though the 
person1 have keep the rhetoric of pron1 thunder and lose the rod of pron1 
lightning pron1 be well for the artist not to live with pope   pron1 be a 
person1 pron1 say of cellini to a conclave of cardinal that common law and 
common authority be not make for man such as pron1   but pron1 be a pope pron1 
person1 cellini into prison and keep pron1 there till pron1 sicken with 
rage and create unreal vision for pron1 and see the gilded sun 
enter pron1 room and grow so enamoured of pron1 pron1 pron1 seek to escape and 
creep out from tower to tower and fall through dizzy air at dawn 
maim pron1 and be by a vine dresser cover with vine leave and 
carry in a cart to ordinal1 pron1 love beautiful thing have care of pron1 
pron1 be danger in pope   and as for the people pron1 of pron1 and pron1 
authority   perhaps of pron1 and pron1 authority pron1 have speak enough 
pron1 authority be a thing blind deaf hideous grotesque tragic 
amuse serious and obscene   pron1 be impossible for the artist to live 
with the people   all despot bribe   the people bribe and person1 
pron1 tell pron1 to exercise authority   pron1 be make to live to listen 
and to love   pron1 have do pron1 a great wrong   pron1 have mar 
pron1 by imitation of pron1 inferior   pron1 have take the sceptre 
of the prince   how should pron1 use pron1   pron1 have take the triple tiara 
of the pope   how should pron1 carry pron1 burden   pron1 be as a clown 
whose heart be break   pron1 be as a priest whose soul be not yet bear 
let all pron1 love beauty pity pron1   though pron1 pron1 love not 
beauty yet let pron1 pity pron1   pron1 teach pron1 the trick of 
person1 

pron1 be many other thing pron1 pron1 might point out   ordinal1 might point 
out how the renaissance be great because pron1 seek to solve no social 
problem and busy pron1 not about such thing but suffer the 
person1 to develop freely beautifully and naturally and so have 
great and individual artist and great and individual man   ordinal1 might 
point out how person1 person1   by create the modern state destroy the 
individualism of the artist and make thing monstrous in pron1 monotony 
of repetition and contemptible in pron1 conformity to rule and 
destroy throughout all person1 all those fine freedom of expression 
that have make tradition new in beauty and new mode ordinal1 with antique 
form   but the past be of no importance   the present be of no 
importance   pron1 be with the future pron1 pron1 have to deal   for the past be 
pron1 man should not have be   the present be pron1 man ought not to be 
the future be pron1 artist be 

pron1 will of course be say that such a scheme as be set forth here be 
quite unpractical and go against human nature   this be perfectly 
true   pron1 be unpractical and pron1 go against human nature   this be why 
pron1 be worth carry out and that be why pron1 propose pron1   for pron1 be a 
practical scheme   a practical scheme be either a scheme pron1 be already 
in existence or a scheme pron1 could be carry out under exist 
condition   but pron1 be exactly the exist condition pron1 ordinal1 object 
to   and any scheme pron1 could accept these condition be wrong and 
foolish   the condition will be do away with and human nature will 
change   the only thing pron1 pron1 really know about human nature be that 
pron1 change   change be the ordinal1 quality pron1 can predicate of pron1   the 
system pron1 fail be those pron1 rely on the permanency of human nature 
and not on pron1 growth and development   the error of person1 person1   be that 
pron1 think human nature would always be the same   the result of pron1 
error be the french revolution   pron1 be an admirable result   all the 
result of the mistake of government be quite admirable 

pron1 be to be note also that individualism do not come to man with any 
person1 can not about duty which merely mean do pron1 other people want 
because pron1 want pron1   or any hideous can not about self sacrifice which be 
merely a survival of savage mutilation   in fact pron1 do not come to man 
with any claim upon pron1 at all   pron1 come naturally and inevitably out 
of man   pron1 be the point to which all development tend   pron1 be the 
differentiation to which all organism grow   pron1 be the perfection pron1 
be inherent in every mode of life and towards which every mode of life 
person1   and so individualism exercise no compulsion over man   on the 
contrary pron1 say to man that pron1 should suffer no compulsion to be 
exercise over pron1   pron1 do not try to force people to be good   pron1 
know that people be good when pron1 be let alone   person1 will develop 
individualism out of pron1   person1 be now so develop individualism 
to ask whether individualism be practical be like ask whether 
person1 be practical   person1 be the law of life and pron1 be no 
evolution except towards individualism   where this tendency be not 
express pron1 be a case of artificially arrest growth or of disease 
or of death 

individualism will also be unselfish and unaffected   pron1 have be point 
out that ordinal1 of the result of the extraordinary tyranny of authority be 
that word be absolutely distorted from pron1 proper and simple meaning 
and be use to express the obverse of pron1 right signification   pron1 
be true about art be true about life   a man be call affected 
nowadays if pron1 dress as pron1 like to dress   but in do that pron1 be 
act in a perfectly natural manner   person1 in such matter 
consist in dress accord to the view of pron1 be neighbour whose 
view as pron1 be the view of the majority will probably be extremely 
stupid   or a man be call selfish if pron1 live in the manner pron1 seem 
to pron1 most suitable for the full realisation of pron1 own personality   if 
in fact the primary aim of pron1 life be self development   but this be 
the way in which pron1 should live   person1 be not live as ordinal1 
wish to live pron1 be ask other to live as ordinal1 wish to live   and 
person1 be let other people be life alone not interfere with 
pron1   person1 always aim at create around pron1 an absolute 
uniformity of type   person1 recognise infinite variety of type as 
a delightful thing accept pron1 acquiesce in pron1 enjoy pron1   pron1 be not 
selfish to think for pron1   a man pron1 do not think for pron1 do 
not think at all   pron1 be grossly selfish to require of one neighbour 
that pron1 should think in the same way and hold the same opinion   why 
should pron1   if pron1 can think pron1 will probably think differently   if pron1 
can not think pron1 be monstrous to require thought of any kind from pron1   a 
person1 rise be not selfish because pron1 want to be a red rise   pron1 would be 
horribly selfish if pron1 want all the other flower in the garden to be 
both red and rose   under individualism people will be quite natural and 
absolutely unselfish and will know the meaning of the word and 
realise pron1 in pron1 free beautiful life   nor will man be egotistic 
as pron1 be now   for the egotist be pron1 pron1 make claim upon other and 
the individualist will not desire to do that   pron1 will not give pron1 
pleasure   when man have realise individualism pron1 will also realise 
sympathy and exercise pron1 freely and spontaneously   up to the present man 
have hardly cultivate sympathy at all   pron1 have merely sympathy with pain 
and sympathy with pain be not the high form of sympathy   all sympathy 
be fine but sympathy with suffering be the least fine mode   pron1 be 
taint with egotism   pron1 be apt to become morbid   pron1 be in pron1 a 
certain element of terror for pron1 own safety   pron1 become afraid that pron1 
pron1 might be as the leper or as the blind and that no man would 
have care of pron1   pron1 be curiously limit too   pron1 should sympathise 
with the entirety of life not with life be sore and malady merely but 
with life be joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom   the wide 
sympathy be of course the more difficult   pron1 require more 
person1   pron1 can sympathise with the suffering of a friend 
but pron1 require a very fine nature pron1 require in fact the nature of a 
true individualist to sympathise with a friend be success 

in the modern stress of competition and struggle for place such sympathy 
be naturally rare and be also very much stifle by the immoral ideal of 
uniformity of type and conformity to rule which be so prevalent 
everywhere and be perhaps most obnoxious in person1 

sympathy with pain pron1 will of course always be   pron1 be ordinal1 of the 
first instinct of man   the animal which be individual the high 
animal pron1 be to say share pron1 with pron1   but pron1 must be remember 
that while sympathy with joy intensify the sum of joy in the world 
sympathy with pain do not really diminish the amount of pain   pron1 may 
make man well able to endure evil but the evil remain   person1 with 
consumption do not cure consumption   that be pron1 science do   and 
when socialism have solve the problem of poverty and science solve the 
problem of disease the area of the sentimentalist will be lessen and 
the sympathy of man will be large healthy and spontaneous   person1 will 
have joy in the contemplation of the joyous life of other 

for pron1 be through joy that the individualism of the future will develop 
pron1   person1 make no attempt to reconstruct society and consequently 
the individualism pron1 pron1 preach to man could be realise only through 
pain or in solitude   the ideal pron1 pron1 owe to person1 be the ideal of 
the man pron1 abandon society entirely or of the man pron1 resist society 
absolutely   but man be naturally social   even the person1 become 
people at last   and though the cenobite realise pron1 personality pron1 be 
often an impoverished personality pron1 pron1 so realise   upon the other 
hand the terrible truth that pain be a mode through which man may 
realise pron1 exercise a wonderful fascination over the world 
shallow speaker and shallow thinker in pulpit and on platform often 
talk about the world be worship of pleasure and whine against pron1   but pron1 
be rarely in the world be history that pron1 ideal have be ordinal1 of joy and 
beauty   the worship of pain have far more often dominate the world 
person1 with pron1 saint and martyr pron1 love of self torture pron1 
wild passion for wound pron1 pron1 gashing with knife and pron1 
whip with rod mediævalism be real christianity and the mediæval 
person1 be the real person1   when the renaissance dawn upon the world 
and bring with pron1 the new ideal of the beauty of life and the joy of 
living man could not understand person1   even art show pron1 that   the 
painter of the renaissance draw person1 as a little boy play with 
another boy in a palace or a garden or lie back in pron1 mother be arm 
smile at pron1 or at a flower or at a bright bird   or as a noble 
stately figure move nobly through the world   or as a wonderful figure 
rise in a sort of ecstasy from death to life   even when pron1 draw pron1 
crucify pron1 draw pron1 as a beautiful god on pron1 evil man have inflict 
suffer   but pron1 do not preoccupy pron1 much   pron1 delight pron1 be 
to paint the man and woman pron1 pron1 admire and to show the loveliness 
of this lovely earth   pron1 paint many religious picture in fact pron1 
paint far too many and the monotony of type and motive be wearisome 
and be bad for art   pron1 be the result of the authority of the public in 
art matter and be to be deplore   but pron1 soul be not in the 
subject   person1 be a great artist when pron1 paint pron1 portrait of the 
person1   when pron1 paint pron1 madonna and infant person1 pron1 be not a great 
artist at all   person1 have no message for the renaissance which be 
wonderful because pron1 bring an ideal at variance with pron1 and to find 
the presentation of the real person1 pron1 must go to mediæval art   there pron1 
be ordinal1 maim and mar   ordinal1 pron1 be not comely to look on because 
beauty be a joy   ordinal1 pron1 be not in fair raiment because that may be a 
person1 also pron1 be a beggar pron1 have a marvellous soul   pron1 be a leper whose 
soul be divine   pron1 need neither property nor health   pron1 be a god 
realise pron1 perfection through pain 

the evolution of man be slow   the injustice of man be great   pron1 be 
necessary that pain should be put forward as a mode of self realisation 
even now in some place in the world the message of person1 be 
necessary   no one pron1 live in modern person1 could possibly realise pron1 
perfection except by pain   a few russian artist have realise 
pron1 in art   in a fiction pron1 be mediæval in character because 
pron1 dominant note be the realisation of man through suffering   but for 
those pron1 be not artist and to pron1 pron1 be no mode of life but the 
actual life of fact pain be the only door to perfection   a russian pron1 
live happily under the present system of government in person1 must 
either believe that man have no soul or that if pron1 have pron1 be not worth 
develop   a nihilist pron1 reject all authority because pron1 know 
authority to be evil and welcome all pain because through that pron1 
person1 pron1 personality be a real christian   to pron1 the christian 
person1 be a true thing 

and yet person1 do not revolt against authority   pron1 accept the 
imperial authority of the roman empire and pay tribute   pron1 endure the 
ecclesiastical authority of the jewish church and would not repel pron1 
violence by any violence of pron1 own   pron1 have as pron1 say before no scheme 
for the reconstruction of society   but the modern world have scheme   pron1 
propose to do away with poverty and the suffering pron1 pron1 entail   pron1 
desire to get rid of pain and the suffering pron1 pain entail   pron1 
trust to socialism and to science as pron1 method   pron1 pron1 aim at be an 
individualism express pron1 through joy   this individualism will be 
large full lovely than any individualism have ever be   person1 be 
not the ultimate mode of perfection   pron1 be merely provisional and a 
person1   pron1 have reference to wrong unhealthy unjust surrounding 
when the wrong and the disease and the injustice be remove pron1 will 
have no further place   pron1 will have do pron1 work   pron1 be a great work 
but pron1 be almost over   pron1 sphere lessen every day 

nor will man miss pron1   for pron1 man have seek for be indeed neither 
pain nor pleasure but simply life   person1 have seek to live intensely 
fully perfectly   when pron1 can do so without exercise restraint on 
other or suffer pron1 ever and pron1 activity be all pleasurable to 
pron1 pron1 will be sane healthy more civilised more pron1   pleasure 
be nature be test pron1 sign of approval   when man be happy pron1 be in 
person1 with pron1 and pron1 environment   the new individualism for 
whose service socialism whether pron1 will pron1 or not be work will be 
person1 harmony   pron1 will be pron1 the person1 seek for but could not 
except in thought realise completely because pron1 have slave and feed 
pron1   pron1 will be pron1 the renaissance seek for but could not realise 
completely except in art because pron1 have slave and starve pron1   pron1 
will be complete and through pron1 each man will attain to pron1 perfection 
the new individualism be the new hellenism
