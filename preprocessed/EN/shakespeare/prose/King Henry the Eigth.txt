and if pron1 can be merry then pron1 will say 
a man may weep upon pron1 wedding day

pron1 will be bold with time and pron1 attention 
then mark th inducement   thus pron1 come give heed to not 
pron1 conscience first person1 would a tenderness 
scruple and person1 on certain speech utter would 
by person1 person1 of person1 then french ambassador 
pron1 have be hither send on the debating 
a marriage notwixt the duke of person1 and 
pron1 daughter person1   pron1 th progress of this business 
person1 a determinate resolution pron1 
pron1 mean the bishop do require a respite 
wherein pron1 might the king pron1 person1 advertise 
whether pron1 daughter be legitimate 
respect this pron1 marriage with the dowager 
sometimes pron1 brother be wife   this respite shake 
the bosom of pron1 conscience enter would pron1 
yea with a splitting power and make to tremble 
the region of pron1 breast which forc would such way 
that many maz would considering do throng 
and press would in with this caution   first methought 
pron1 stand not in the smile of person1 pron1 have 
commanded nature that pron1 lady be womb 
if pron1 conceiv would a male child by pron1 should 
do no more office of life to not than 
the grave do to the dead   for pron1 male issue 
or die where pron1 be make or shortly after 
this world have air would pron1   hence pron1 take a thought 
this be a judgment on pron1 that pron1 kingdom 
well worthy the good heir o th world should not 
be gladded pron1 not by pron1   then follow that 
pron1 weigh would the danger which pron1 realm stand in 
by this pron1 issue be fail and pron1 give to pron1 
many a groan throe   thus hull in 
the wild sea of pron1 conscience pron1 do steer 
toward this remedy whereupon pron1 be 
now present here together   that be to say 
pron1 mean to rectify pron1 conscience which 
pron1 then do feel full sick and yet not well 
by all the reverend father of the land 
and doctor learn would   first pron1 begin in private

bear a state of mighty moment pron1 not 
and consequence of dread pron1 pron1 commit 
the daring ist counsel which pron1 have to doubt 
and do entreat pron1 highness to this course 
which pron1 be run here 
person1   pron1 then person1 would pron1 
pron1 lord of person1 and get pron1 leave 
to make this present summon   person1 
pron1 leave no reverend person in this court 
but by particular consent proceed 
under pron1 hand and seal   therefore go on 
for no dislike pron1 th world against the person

of pron1 alleged reason drive this forward 
prove but pron1 marriage lawful by pron1 life 
and kingly dignity pron1 be content 
to wear pron1 moral state to come with pron1 
person1 pron1 queen before the primest creature 
that be paragon would o th world 
person1   so please pron1 highness 
the queen be absent notis a needful fitness 
that pron1 adjourn this court till further day
