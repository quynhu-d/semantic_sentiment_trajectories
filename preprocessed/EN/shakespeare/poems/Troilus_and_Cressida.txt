scene ordinal1   the grecian camp   before agamemnon be tent 
person1   enter person1 person1 person1 person1 and other 
person1 
prince 
pron1 grief hath set the jaundice on pron1 cheek 
the ample proposition pron1 hope make 
in all design begin on earth below 
fail in the promised largeness cheque and disaster 
grow in the vein of action high rear would 
as knot by the conflux of meet sap 
infect the sound pine and divert pron1 grain 
tortive and errant from pron1 course of growth 
nor prince be pron1 matter new to pron1 
that pron1 come short of pron1 suppose so far 
that after ordinal1 year siege yet person1 wall stand 
person1 every action pron1 hath go before 
whereof pron1 have record trial do draw 
bias and thwart not answer the aim 
and that unbodied figure of the thought 
that give not surmise shape   why then pron1 prince 
do pron1 with cheek abash would behold pron1 work 
and call pron1 shame   which be indeed nought else 
but the protractive trial of great jove 
to find persistive constancy in man 
the fineness of which metal be not find 
in fortune be love   for then the bold and coward 
the wise and fool the artist and unread 
the hard and soft seem all affine and kin 
but in the wind and tempest of pron1 frown 
distinction with a broad and powerful fan 
puff at all winnow the light away 
and pron1 hath mass or matter by pron1 
lie rich in virtue and unmingled 
person1 
with due observance of pron1 godlike seat 
great agamemnon nestor shall apply 
thy late word   in the reproof of chance 
lie the true proof of man the sea be smooth 
how many shallow bauble boat dare sail 
upon pron1 patient breast make pron1 way 
with those of nobler bulk 
but let the ruffian person1 once enrage 
the gentle thetis and person1 person1 
the strong ribb would bark through liquid mountain cut 
bound between the ordinal1 moist element 
like perseus horse where be then the person1 boat 
pron1 weak pron1 would side but even now 
co rivall would greatness   either to harbour flee 
or make a toast for neptune   even so 
person1 person1 be show and person1 be worth divide 
in storm of fortune   for in pron1 ray and brightness 
the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze 
than by the tiger   but when the splitting wind 
make flexible the knee of knot oak 
and fly flee under shade why then the thing of courage 
as rouse with rage with rage doth sympathize 
and with an accent tune in selfsame key 
retort to chide fortune 
person1 
person1 
thou great commander nerve and bone of person1 
heart of pron1 number soul and only spirit 
in pron1 the temper and the mind of all 
should be shut up hear pron1 person1 speak 
besides the applause and approbation to which 
to agamemnon 

most mighty for pron1 place and sway 
to nestor 

and thou most reverend for pron1 stretch would out life 
pron1 give to both pron1 speech which be such 
as agamemnon and the hand of person1 
should hold up high in brass and such again 
as venerable nestor hatch would in silver 
should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree 
on which person1 ride knit all the greekish ear 
to pron1 experienced tongue yet let pron1 please both 
thou great and wise to hear ulysse speak 
person1 
speak prince of person1   and be not of less expect 
that matter needless of importless burden 
divide pron1 lip than pron1 be confident 
when rank thersite ope pron1 mastic jaw 
pron1 shall hear music wit and oracle 
person1 
person1 yet upon pron1 basis have be down 
and the great hector be sword have lack would a master 
but for these instance 
the specialty of rule hath be neglect 
and look how many grecian tent do stand 
hollow upon this plain so many hollow faction 
when that the general be not like the hive 
to pron1 the forager shall all repair 
pron1 honey be expect   degree be vizarded 
the unworthi show as fairly in the mask 
the heaven pron1 the planet and this centre 
observe degree priority and place 
insisture course proportion season form 
office and custom in all line of order 
and therefore be the glorious planet sol 
in noble eminence enthrone and sphere

in mere oppugnancy the bound water

strength should be person1 of imbecility 
and the rude son should strike pron1 father dead 
force should be right   or rather right and wrong 
between whose endless jar justice reside 
should lose pron1 name and so should justice too 
then every thing include pron1 in power 
power into will will into appetite
