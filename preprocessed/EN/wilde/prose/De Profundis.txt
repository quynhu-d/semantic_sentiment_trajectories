for pron1 pron1 be only ordinal1 season the season of sorrow   the very sun and moon seem take from pron1   outside the day may be blue and gold but the light pron1 creep down through the thickly muffled glass of the small iron bar window beneath which pron1 sit be grey and person1   pron1 be always twilight in ordinal1 be cell as pron1 be always twilight in ordinal1 be heart   and in the sphere of thought no less than in the sphere of time motion be no more   the thing pron1 pron1 personally have long ago forget or can easily forget be happen to pron1 now and will happen to pron1 again to morrow   remember this and pron1 will be able to understand a little of why pron1 be write and in this manner writing

ordinal1 month go over   the calendar of pron1 daily conduct and labour pron1 hang on the outside of pron1 cell door with pron1 name and sentence write upon pron1 tell pron1 that pron1 be may          

prosperity pleasure and success may be rough of grain and common in fibre but sorrow be the most sensitive of all create thing   pron1 be pron1 pron1 stir in the whole world of thought to which sorrow do not vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation   the thin beat out leaf of tremulous gold pron1 chronicle the direction of force the eye can not see be in comparison coarse   pron1 be a wound pron1 bleed when any hand but that of love touch pron1 and even then must bleed again though not in pain 

where pron1 be sorrow pron1 be holy ground   some day people will realise pron1 that mean   pron1 will know pron1 of life till pron1 do and nature like pron1 can realise pron1   when pron1 be bring down from pron1 prison to the court of bankruptcy between ordinal1 policeman wait in the long dreary corridor that before the whole crowd pron1 an action so sweet and simple hush into silence pron1 might gravely raise pron1 hat to pron1 as handcuff and with bow head pron1 pass pron1 by   man have go to person1 for small thing than that   pron1 be in this spirit and with this mode of love pron1 the saint kneel down to wash the foot of the poor or stoop to kiss the leper on the cheek   pron1 have never say ordinal1 single word to pron1 about pron1 pron1 do   pron1 do not know to the present moment whether pron1 be aware that pron1 be even conscious of pron1 action   pron1 be not a thing for which pron1 can render formal thank in formal word   pron1 store pron1 in the treasure house of pron1 heart   pron1 keep pron1 there as a secret debt pron1 pron1 be glad to think pron1 can never possibly repay   pron1 be embalm and keep sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tear   when wisdom have be profitless to pron1 philosophy barren and the proverb and phrase of those pron1 have seek to give pron1 consolation as dust and ashe in pron1 mouth the memory of that little lovely silent act of love have unseal for pron1 all the well of pity make the desert blossom like a rose and bring pron1 out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wound broken and great heart of the world   when people be able to understand not merely how beautiful be action be but why pron1 mean so much to pron1 and always will mean so much then perhaps pron1 will realise how and in pron1 spirit pron1 should approach pron1          

the poor be wise more charitable more kind more sensitive than pron1 be   in pron1 eye prison be a tragedy in a man be life a misfortune a casuality pron1 pron1 call for sympathy in other   pron1 speak of ordinal1 pron1 be in prison as of ordinal1 pron1 be in trouble simply   pron1 be the phrase pron1 always use and the expression have the perfect wisdom of love in pron1   with people of pron1 own rank pron1 be different   with person1 prison make a man a pariah   pron1 and such as pron1 be have hardly any right to air and sun   pron1 presence taint the pleasure of other   pron1 be unwelcome when pron1 reappear   to revisit the glimpse of the moon be not for pron1   pron1 very child be take away   those lovely link with humanity be break   pron1 be doom to be solitary while pron1 son still live   pron1 be deny the ordinal1 thing pron1 might heal pron1 and keep pron1 pron1 might bring balm to the bruise heart and peace to the soul in pain          

pron1 must say to pron1 that pron1 ruin pron1 and that pron1 great or small can be ruin except by pron1 own hand   pron1 be quite ready to say so   pron1 be try to say so though pron1 may not think pron1 at the present moment   this pitiless indictment pron1 bring without pity against pron1   terrible as be pron1 the world do to pron1 pron1 pron1 do to pron1 be far more terrible still 

pron1 be a man pron1 stand in symbolic relation to the art and culture of pron1 age   pron1 have realise this for pron1 at the very dawn of pron1 manhood and have force pron1 age to realise pron1 afterwards   few man hold such a position in pron1 own lifetime and have pron1 so acknowledge   pron1 be usually discern if discern at all by the historian or the critic long after both the man and pron1 age have pass away   with pron1 pron1 be different   pron1 feel pron1 pron1 and make other feel pron1   person1 be a symbolic figure but pron1 relation be to the passion of pron1 age and pron1 weariness of passion   person1 be to pron1 more noble more permanent of more vital issue of large scope 

the god have give pron1 almost pron1   but pron1 let pron1 be lure into long spell of senseless and sensual ease   pron1 amuse pron1 with be a flâneur a dandy a man of fashion   pron1 surround pron1 with the small nature and the mean mind   pron1 become the spendthrift of pron1 own genius and to waste an eternal youth give pron1 a curious joy   person1 of be on the height pron1 deliberately go to the depth in the search for new sensation   pron1 the paradox be to pron1 in the sphere of thought perversity become to pron1 in the sphere of passion   person1 at the end be a malady or a madness or both   pron1 grow careless of the life of other   pron1 take pleasure where pron1 please pron1 and pass on   pron1 forget that every little action of the common day make or unmake character and that therefore pron1 pron1 have do in the secret chamber pron1 have some day to cry aloud on the housetop   pron1 cease to be person1 over pron1   pron1 be no long the captain of pron1 soul and do not know pron1   pron1 allow pleasure to dominate pron1   pron1 end in horrible disgrace   pron1 be only ordinal1 thing for pron1 now absolute humility 

pron1 have lie in prison for nearly ordinal1 year   out of pron1 nature have come wild despair   an abandonment to grief pron1 be piteous even to look at   terrible and impotent rage   bitterness and scorn   person1 pron1 weep aloud   misery pron1 could find no voice   person1 pron1 be dumb   pron1 have pass through every possible mood of suffering   well than wordsworth pron1 pron1 know pron1 wordsworth mean when pron1 say 

  suffering be permanent obscure and dark 
and have the nature of infinity   

but while pron1 be time when pron1 rejoice in the idea that pron1 suffering be to be endless pron1 could not bear pron1 to be without meaning   now pron1 find hide somewhere away in pron1 nature pron1 pron1 tell pron1 that pron1 in the whole world be meaningless and suffer least of all   that pron1 hide away in pron1 nature like a treasure in a field be humility 

pron1 be the last thing leave in pron1 and the good the ultimate discovery at which pron1 have arrive the starting point for a fresh development   pron1 have come to pron1 right out of pron1 so pron1 know that pron1 have come at the proper time   pron1 could not have come before nor later   have any one tell pron1 of pron1 pron1 would have reject pron1   have pron1 be bring to pron1 pron1 would have refuse pron1   as pron1 find pron1 pron1 want to keep pron1   pron1 must do so   pron1 be the ordinal1 thing pron1 have in pron1 the element of life of a new person1 person1 person1 for pron1   of all thing pron1 be the strange   pron1 can not acquire pron1 except by surrender pron1 pron1 pron1 have   pron1 be only when pron1 have lose all thing pron1 pron1 know that pron1 possess pron1 

now pron1 have realise that pron1 be in pron1 pron1 see quite clearly pron1 pron1 ought to do   in fact must do   and when pron1 use such a phrase as that pron1 need not say that pron1 be not allude to any external sanction or command   pron1 admit none   pron1 be far more of an individualist than pron1 ever be   pron1 seem to pron1 of the small value except pron1 pron1 get out of pron1   pron1 nature be seek a fresh mode of self realisation   that be all pron1 be concern with   and the first thing pron1 pron1 have get to do be to free pron1 from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world 

pron1 be completely penniless and absolutely homeless   yet pron1 be bad thing in the world than that   pron1 be quite candid when pron1 say that rather than go out from this prison with bitterness in pron1 heart against the world pron1 would gladly and readily beg pron1 bread from door to door   if pron1 get pron1 from the house of the rich pron1 would get pron1 at the house of the poor   those pron1 have much be often greedy   those pron1 have little always share   pron1 would not a bit mind sleep in the cool grass in summer and when winter come on shelter pron1 by the warm close thatch person1 or under the penthouse of a great barn provide pron1 have love in pron1 heart   the external thing of life seem to pron1 now of no importance at all   pron1 can see to what intensity of individualism pron1 have arrive or be arrive rather for the journey be long and where pron1 walk there be thorn   

of course pron1 know that to ask alm on the highway be not to be pron1 lot and that if ever pron1 lie in the cool grass at night time pron1 will be to write sonnet to the moon   when pron1 go out of prison r will be wait for pron1 on the other side of the big iron studded gate and pron1 be the symbol not merely of pron1 own affection but of the affection of many other besides   pron1 believe pron1 be to have enough to live on for about ordinal1 month at any rate so that if pron1 may not write beautiful book pron1 may at least read beautiful book   and what joy can be great   after that pron1 hope to be able to recreate pron1 creative faculty 

but be thing different have pron1 not a friend leave in the world   be pron1 not a single house open to pron1 in pity   have pron1 to accept the wallet and rag cloak of sheer penury as long as pron1 be free from all resentment hardness and scorn pron1 would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than pron1 would be pron1 body in purple and fine linen and the soul within pron1 sick with hate 

and pron1 really shall have no difficulty   when pron1 really want love pron1 will find pron1 wait for pron1 

pron1 need not say that pron1 task do not end there   pron1 would be comparatively easy if pron1 do   pron1 be much more before pron1   pron1 have hill far steep to climb valley much dark to pass through   and pron1 have to get pron1 all out of pron1   neither religion morality nor reason can help pron1 at all 

morality do not help pron1   pron1 be a bear antinomian   pron1 be ordinal1 of those pron1 be make for exception not for law   but while pron1 see that pron1 be pron1 wrong in pron1 one do pron1 see that pron1 be pron1 wrong in pron1 pron1 become   pron1 be well to have learn that 

religion do not help pron1   the faith pron1 other give to pron1 be unseen pron1 give to pron1 pron1 can touch and look at   pron1 god dwell in temple make with hand   and within the circle of actual experience be pron1 creed make perfect and complete too complete pron1 may be for like many or all of those pron1 have place pron1 heaven in this earth pron1 have find in pron1 not merely the beauty of person1 but the horror of hell also   when pron1 think about religion at all pron1 feel as if pron1 would like to find an order for those pron1 can not believe the confraternity of the faithless one might call pron1 where on an altar on which no taper burn a priest in whose heart peace have no dwelling might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine   every thing to be true must become a religion   and agnosticism should have pron1 ritual no less than faith   pron1 have sow pron1 martyr pron1 should reap pron1 saint and praise person1 daily for have hide pron1 from man   but whether pron1 be faith or agnosticism pron1 must be pron1 external to pron1   pron1 symbol must be of pron1 own creating   only that be spiritual which make pron1 own form   if pron1 may not find pron1 secret within pron1 pron1 shall never find pron1 if pron1 have not get pron1 already pron1 will never come to pron1 

reason do not help pron1   pron1 tell pron1 that the law under which pron1 be convict be wrong and unjust law and the system under which pron1 have suffer a wrong and unjust system   but somehow pron1 have get to make both of these thing just and right to pron1   and exactly as in art ordinal1 be only concerned with pron1 a particular thing be at a particular moment to pron1 so pron1 be also in the ethical evolution of ordinal1 be character   pron1 have get to make pron1 pron1 have happen to pron1 good for pron1   the plank bed the loathsome food the hard rope shred into oakum till one be finger tip grow dull with pain the menial office with which each day begin and finish the harsh order pron1 routine seem to necessitate the dreadful dress pron1 make sorrow grotesque to look at the silence the solitude the shame each and all of these thing pron1 have to transform into a spiritual experience   pron1 be not a single degradation of the body which pron1 must not try and make into a spiritualising of the soul 

pron1 want to get to the point when pron1 shall be able to say quite simply and without affectation that the ordinal1 great turning point in pron1 life be when pron1 father send pron1 to person1 and when society send pron1 to prison   pron1 will not say that prison be the good thing pron1 could have happen to pron1 for that phrase would savour of too great bitterness towards pron1   pron1 would soon say or hear pron1 say of pron1 that pron1 be so typical a child of pron1 age that in pron1 perversity and for that perversity be sake pron1 turn the good thing of pron1 life to evil and the evil thing of pron1 life to good 

pron1 be say however by pron1 or by other matter little   the important thing the thing pron1 lie before pron1 the thing pron1 pron1 have to do if the brief remainder of pron1 day be not to be maim mar and incomplete be to absorb into pron1 nature all pron1 have be do to pron1 to make pron1 part of pron1 to accept pron1 without complaint fear or reluctance   the supreme vice be shallowness   whatever be realise be right 

when first pron1 be put into prison some people advise pron1 to try and forget pron1 pron1 be   pron1 be ruinous advice   pron1 be only by realise pron1 pron1 be that pron1 have find comfort of any kind   now pron1 be advise by other to try on pron1 release to forget that pron1 have ever be in a prison at all   pron1 know that would be equally fatal   pron1 would mean that pron1 would always be haunt by an intolerable sense of disgrace and that those thing pron1 be mean for pron1 as much as for pron1 else the beauty of the sun and moon the pageant of the season the music of daybreak and the silence of great night the rain fall through the leave or the dew creep over the grass and make pron1 silver would all be taint for pron1 and lose pron1 healing power and pron1 power of communicate joy   to regret ordinal1 be own experience be to arrest pron1 be own development   to deny ordinal1 be own experience be to put a lie into the lip of pron1 be own life   pron1 be no less than a denial of the soul 

for just as the body absorb thing of all kind thing common and unclean no less than those pron1 the priest or a vision have cleanse and convert pron1 into swiftness or strength into the play of beautiful muscle and the moulding of fair flesh into the curve and colour of the hair the lip the eye   so the soul in pron1 turn have pron1 nutritive function also and can transform into noble mood of thought and passion of high import pron1 in pron1 be base cruel and degrading   person1 more may find in these pron1 most person1 mode of assertion and can often reveal pron1 most perfectly through pron1 be intend to desecrate or destroy 

the fact of pron1 have be the common prisoner of a common gaol pron1 must frankly accept and curious as pron1 may seem ordinal1 of the thing pron1 shall have to teach pron1 be not to be ashamed of pron1   pron1 must accept pron1 as a punishment and if pron1 be ashamed of have be punish ordinal1 might just as well never have be punish at all   of course pron1 be many thing of which pron1 be convict that pron1 have not do but then pron1 be many thing of which pron1 be convict that pron1 have do and a still great number of thing in pron1 life for which pron1 be never indict at all   and as the god be strange and punish pron1 for pron1 be good and humane in pron1 as much as for pron1 be evil and perverse pron1 must accept the fact that one be punish for the good as well as for the evil pron1 pron1 do   pron1 have no doubt that pron1 be quite right one should be   pron1 help ordinal1 or should help ordinal1 to realise both and not to be too conceited about either   and if pron1 then be not ashamed of pron1 punishment as pron1 hope not to be pron1 shall be able to think and walk and live with freedom 

many man on pron1 release carry pron1 prison about with pron1 into the air and hide pron1 as a secret disgrace in pron1 heart and at length like poor poison thing creep into some hole and die   pron1 be wretched that pron1 should have to do so and pron1 be wrong terribly wrong of society that pron1 should force pron1 to do so   person1 take upon pron1 the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual but pron1 also have the supreme vice of shallowness and fail to realise pron1 pron1 have do   when the man be punishment be over pron1 leave pron1 to pron1   that be to say pron1 abandon pron1 at the very moment when pron1 high duty towards pron1 begin   pron1 be really ashamed of pron1 own action and shun those pron1 pron1 have punish as people shun a creditor whose debt pron1 can not pay or ordinal1 on pron1 pron1 have inflict an irreparable an irremediable wrong   pron1 can claim on pron1 side that if pron1 realise pron1 pron1 have suffer society should realise pron1 pron1 have inflict on pron1   and that pron1 should be no bitterness or hate on either side 

of course pron1 know that from ordinal1 point of view thing will be make different for pron1 than for other   must indeed by the very nature of the case be make so   the poor thief and outcast pron1 be imprison here with pron1 be in many respect more fortunate than pron1 be   the little way in grey city or green field pron1 see pron1 sin be small   to find those pron1 know pron1 of pron1 pron1 have do pron1 need go no far than a bird might fly between the twilight and the dawn   but for pron1 the world be shrivel to a handsbreadth and everywhere pron1 turn pron1 name be write on the rock in lead   for pron1 have come not from obscurity into the momentary notoriety of crime but from a sort of eternity of fame to a sort of eternity of infamy and sometimes seem to pron1 to have show if indeed pron1 require show that between the famous and the infamous pron1 be but ordinal1 step if as much as ordinal1 

still in the very fact that people will recognise pron1 wherever pron1 go and know all about pron1 life as far as pron1 folly go pron1 can discern pron1 good for pron1   pron1 will force on pron1 the necessity of again assert pron1 as an artist and as soon as pron1 possibly can   if pron1 can produce only ordinal1 beautiful work of art pron1 shall be able to rob malice of pron1 venom and cowardice of pron1 sneer and to pluck out the tongue of scorn by the root 

and if life be as pron1 surely be a problem to pron1 pron1 be no less a problem to life   people must adopt some attitude towards pron1 and so pass judgment both on pron1 and pron1   pron1 need not say pron1 be not talk of particular individual   the only people pron1 would care to be with now be artist and people pron1 have suffer those pron1 know pron1 beauty be and those pron1 know pron1 sorrow be pron1 else interest pron1   nor be pron1 make any demand on life   in all pron1 pron1 have say pron1 be simply concerned with pron1 own mental attitude towards life as a whole   and pron1 feel that not to be ashamed of have be punish be ordinal1 of the first point pron1 must attain to for the sake of pron1 own perfection and because pron1 be so imperfect 

then pron1 must learn how to be happy   once pron1 know pron1 or think pron1 know pron1 by instinct   pron1 be always springtime once in pron1 heart   pron1 temperament be akin to joy   pron1 fill pron1 life to the very brim with pleasure as pron1 might fill a cup to the very brim with wine   now pron1 be approach life from a completely new standpoint and even to conceive happiness be often extremely difficult for pron1   pron1 remember during pron1 first term at person1 reading in person1 be renaissance that book which have have such strange influence over pron1 life how person1 place low in the inferno those pron1 wilfully live in sadness   and go to the college library and turn to the passage in the divine comedy where beneath the dreary person1 lie those pron1 be isullen in the sweet air say for ever and ever through pron1 sigh 

pron1 know the church condemn person1 but the whole idea seem to pron1 quite fantastic just the sort of sin pron1 fancy a priest pron1 know pron1 about real life would invent   nor could pron1 understand how person1 pron1 say that person1 remarry pron1 to person1 could have be so harsh to those pron1 be enamoured of melancholy if any such pron1 really be   pron1 have no idea that some day this would become to pron1 ordinal1 of the great temptation of pron1 life 

while pron1 be in wandsworth prison pron1 long to die   pron1 be pron1 ordinal1 desire   when after ordinal1 month in the infirmary pron1 be transfer here and find pron1 grow gradually well in physical health pron1 be fill with rage   pron1 determine to commit suicide on the very day on which pron1 leave prison   after a time pron1 evil mood pass away and pron1 make up pron1 mind to live but to wear gloom as a king wear purple never to smile again to turn whatever house pron1 enter into a house of mourning to make pron1 friend walk slowly in sadness with pron1 to teach pron1 that melancholy be the true secret of life to maim pron1 with an alien sorrow to mar pron1 with pron1 own pain   now pron1 feel quite differently   pron1 see pron1 would be both ungrateful and unkind of pron1 to pull so long a face that when pron1 friend come to see pron1 pron1 would have to make pron1 face still long in order to show pron1 sympathy   or if pron1 desire to entertain pron1 to invite pron1 to sit down silently to bitter herb and funeral baked meat   pron1 must learn how to be cheerful and happy 

the last ordinal1 occasion on which pron1 be allow to see pron1 friend here pron1 try to be as cheerful as possible and to show pron1 cheerfulness in order to make pron1 some slight return for pron1 trouble in come all the way from town to see pron1   pron1 be only a slight return pron1 know but pron1 be the one pron1 feel certain that please pron1 most   pron1 see r for an hour on person1 week and pron1 try to give the full possible expression of the delight pron1 really feel at pron1 meeting   and that in the view and idea pron1 be here shape for pron1 pron1 be quite right be show to pron1 by the fact that now for the first time since pron1 imprisonment pron1 have a real desire for life 

pron1 be before pron1 so much to do that pron1 would regard pron1 as a terrible tragedy if pron1 die before pron1 be allow to complete at any rate a little of pron1   pron1 see new development in art and life each ordinal1 of which be a fresh mode of perfection   pron1 long to live so that pron1 can explore pron1 be no less than a new world to pron1   do pron1 want to know pron1 this new world be   pron1 think pron1 can guess pron1 pron1 be   pron1 be the world in which pron1 have be live   person1 then and all pron1 pron1 teach ordinal1 be pron1 new world 

pron1 use to live entirely for pleasure   pron1 shun suffer and sorrow of every kind   pron1 hate both   pron1 resolve to ignore pron1 as far as possible to treat pron1 pron1 be to say as mode of imperfection   pron1 be not part of pron1 scheme of life   pron1 have no place in pron1 philosophy   pron1 mother pron1 know life as a whole use often to quote to pron1 goethe be line write by person1 in a book pron1 have give pron1 year ago and translate by pron1 pron1 fancy also 

  pron1 never eat pron1 bread in sorrow 
pron1 never spend the midnight hour 
weep and wait for the morrow 
pron1 know pron1 not ye heavenly power   

pron1 be the line which that noble queen of person1 pron1 person1 treat with such coarse brutality use to quote in pron1 humiliation and exile   pron1 be the line pron1 mother often quote in the trouble of pron1 later life   pron1 absolutely decline to accept or admit the enormous truth hide in pron1   pron1 could not understand pron1   pron1 remember quite well how pron1 use to tell pron1 that pron1 do not want to eat pron1 bread in sorrow or to pass any night weep and watch for a more bitter dawn 

pron1 have no idea that pron1 be ordinal1 of the special thing pron1 the fate have in store for pron1 that for a whole year of pron1 life indeed pron1 be to do little else   but so have pron1 portion be mete out to pron1   and during the last few month pron1 have after terrible difficulty and struggle be able to comprehend some of the lesson hide in the heart of pain   clergyman and people pron1 use phrase without wisdom sometimes talk of suffering as a mystery   pron1 be really a revelation   ordinal1 discern thing ordinal1 never discern before   ordinal1 approach the whole of history from a different standpoint   pron1 pron1 have feel dimly through instinct about art be intellectually and emotionally realise with perfect clearness of vision and absolute intensity of apprehension 

pron1 now see that sorrow be the supreme emotion of which man be capable be at once the type and test of all great art   pron1 the artist be always look for be the mode of existence in which soul and body be ordinal1 and indivisible in which the outward be expressive of the inward in which form reveal   of such mode of existence pron1 be not a few youth and the art preoccupy with youth may serve as a model for pron1 at ordinal1 moment at another pron1 may like to think that in pron1 subtlety and sensitiveness of impression pron1 suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external thing and make pron1 raiment of earth and air of mist and city alike and in pron1 morbid sympathy of pron1 mood and tone and colour modern landscape art be realise for pron1 pictorially pron1 be realise in such plastic perfection by the person1   music in which all subject be absorb in expression and can not be separate from pron1 be a complex example and a flower or a child a simple example of pron1 pron1 mean   but sorrow be the ultimate type both in life and art 

behind joy and laughter pron1 may be a temperament coarse hard and callous   but behind sorrow pron1 be always sorrow   pain unlike pleasure wear no mask   person1 in art be not any correspondence between the essential idea and the accidental existence   pron1 be not the resemblance of shape to shadow or of the form mirror in the crystal to the form pron1   pron1 be no echo come from a hollow hill any more than pron1 be a silver well of water in the valley pron1 show the moon to the moon and narcissus to narcissus   person1 in art be the unity of a thing with pron1 the outward render expressive of the inward the soul make incarnate the body instinct with spirit   for this reason pron1 be no truth comparable to sorrow   pron1 be time when sorrow seem to pron1 to be the only truth   other thing may be illusion of the eye or the appetite make to blind the ordinal1 and cloy the other but out of sorrow have the world be build and at the birth of a child or a star pron1 be pain 

more than this pron1 be about sorrow an intense an extraordinary reality   pron1 have say of pron1 that pron1 be ordinal1 pron1 stand in symbolic relation to the art and culture of pron1 age   pron1 be not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with pron1 pron1 do not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life   for the secret of life be suffer   pron1 be pron1 be hide behind pron1   when pron1 begin to live pron1 be sweet be so sweet to pron1 and pron1 be bitter so bitter that pron1 inevitably direct all pron1 desire towards pleasure and seek not merely for a amonth or twain to feed on honeycomb but for all pron1 year to taste no other food ignorant all the while that pron1 may really be starve the soul 

pron1 remember talk once on this subject to ordinal1 of the most beautiful personality pron1 have ever know a woman whose sympathy and noble kindness to pron1 both before and since the tragedy of pron1 imprisonment have be beyond power and description   ordinal1 pron1 have really assist pron1 though pron1 do not know pron1 to bear the burden of pron1 trouble more than any one else in the whole world have and all through the mere fact of pron1 existence through pron1 be pron1 pron1 be partly an ideal and partly an influence a suggestion of pron1 pron1 might become as well as a real help towards become pron1   a soul pron1 render the common air sweet and make pron1 be spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea ordinal1 for pron1 beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand and have the same message   on the occasion of which pron1 be think pron1 recall distinctly how pron1 say to pron1 that pron1 be enough suffering in ordinal1 narrow person1 person1 to show that person1 do not love man and that wherever pron1 be any sorrow though but that of a child in some little garden weep over a fault pron1 pron1 have or have not commit the whole face of creation be completely mar   pron1 be entirely wrong   pron1 tell pron1 so but pron1 could not believe pron1   pron1 be not in the sphere in which such belief be to be attain to   now pron1 seem to pron1 that love of some kind be the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffer that pron1 be in the world   pron1 can not conceive of any other explanation   pron1 be convinced that pron1 be no other and that if the world have indeed as pron1 have say be build of sorrow pron1 have be build by the hand of love because in no other way could the soul of man for pron1 the world be make reach the full stature of pron1 perfection   pleasure for the beautiful body but pain for the beautiful soul 

when pron1 say that pron1 be convinced of these thing pron1 speak with too much pride   far off like a perfect pearl pron1 can see the city of person1   pron1 be so wonderful that pron1 seem as if a child could reach pron1 in a summer be day   and so a child could   but with pron1 and such as pron1 pron1 be different   pron1 can realise a thing in a single moment but one lose pron1 in the long hour pron1 follow with leaden foot   pron1 be so difficult to keep height pron1 the soul be competent to gain   pron1 think in eternity but pron1 move slowly through time   and how slowly time go with pron1 pron1 lie in prison pron1 need not tell again nor of the weariness and despair pron1 creep back into ordinal1 be cell and into the cell of ordinal1 be heart with such strange insistence that pron1 have as pron1 be to garnish and sweep ordinal1 be house for pron1 come as for an unwelcome guest or a bitter master or a slave whose slave pron1 be ordinal1 be chance or choice to be 

and though at present pron1 friend may find pron1 a hard thing to believe pron1 be true none the less that for pron1 live in freedom and idleness and comfort pron1 be more easy to learn the lesson of humility than pron1 be for pron1 pron1 begin the day by go down on pron1 knee and wash the floor of pron1 cell   for prison life with pron1 endless privation and restriction make ordinal1 rebellious   the most terrible thing about pron1 be not that pron1 break ordinal1 be heart heart be make to be break but that pron1 turn ordinal1 be heart to stone   ordinal1 sometimes feel that pron1 be only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn pron1 pron1 can get through the day at all   and pron1 pron1 be in a state of rebellion can not receive grace to use the phrase of which the church be so fond so rightly fond pron1 dare say for in life as in art the mood of rebellion close up the channel of the soul and shut out the air of person1   yet pron1 must learn these lesson here if pron1 be to learn pron1 anywhere and must be fill with joy if pron1 foot be on the right road and pron1 face set towards person1 gate which be call beautiful though pron1 may fall many time in the mire and often in the mist go astray 

this new life as through pron1 love of person1 pron1 like sometimes to call pron1 be of course no new life at all but simply the continuance by mean of development and evolution of pron1 former life   pron1 remember when pron1 be at person1 say to ordinal1 of pron1 friend as pron1 be stroll round person1 be narrow bird haunt walk ordinal1 morning in the year before pron1 take pron1 degree that pron1 want to eat of the fruit of all the tree in the garden of the world and that pron1 be go out into the world with that passion in pron1 soul   and so indeed pron1 go out and so pron1 live   pron1 only mistake be that pron1 confine pron1 so exclusively to the tree of pron1 seem to pron1 the sun light side of the garden and shun the other side for pron1 shadow and pron1 gloom   failure disgrace poverty sorrow despair suffer tear even the broken word pron1 come from lip in pain remorse pron1 make ordinal1 walk on thorn conscience pron1 condemn self abasement pron1 punish the misery pron1 put ashe on pron1 head the anguish pron1 choose sack cloth for pron1 raiment and into pron1 own drink put gall all these be thing of which pron1 be afraid   and as pron1 have determine to know pron1 of pron1 pron1 be force to taste each of pron1 in turn to feed on pron1 to have for a season indeed no other food at all 

pron1 do not regret for a single moment have live for pleasure   pron1 do pron1 to the full as pron1 should do pron1 pron1 pron1 do   pron1 be no pleasure pron1 do not experience   pron1 throw the pearl of pron1 soul into a cup of wine   pron1 go down the primrose path to the sound of flute   pron1 live on honeycomb   but to have continue the same life would have be wrong because pron1 would have be limit   pron1 have to pass on   the other half of the garden have pron1 secret for pron1 also   of course all this be foreshadow and prefigure in pron1 book   some of pron1 be in the happy prince some of pron1 in the young king notably in the passage where the person1 say to the kneeling boy be not pron1 pron1 make misery wise than thou art     a phrase which when pron1 write pron1 seem to pron1 little more than a phrase   a great deal of pron1 be hide away in the note of doom that like a purple thread run through the texture of dorian gray   in the critic as artist pron1 be set forth in many colour   in the soul of man pron1 be write down and in letter too easy to read   pron1 be ordinal1 of the refrain whose recur motif make salome so like a piece of music and bind pron1 together as a ballad   in the prose poem of the man pron1 from the bronze of the image of the pleasure pron1 liveth for a moment have to make the image of the sorrow pron1 person1 for ever pron1 be incarnate   pron1 could not have be otherwise   at every single moment of ordinal1 be life ordinal1 be pron1 pron1 be go to be no less than pron1 pron1 have be   art be a symbol because man be a symbol 

pron1 be if pron1 can fully attain to pron1 the ultimate realisation of the artistic life   for the artistic life be simply self development   person1 in the artist be pron1 frank acceptance of all experience just as love in the artist be simply the sense of beauty pron1 reveal to the world pron1 body and pron1 soul   in marius the epicurean person1 seek to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion in the deep sweet and austere sense of the word   but person1 be little more than a spectator an ideal spectator indeed and ordinal1 to pron1 pron1 be give noto contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotion which wordsworth define as the poet be true aim   yet a spectator merely and perhaps a little too much occupy with the comeliness of the bench of the sanctuary to notice that pron1 be the sanctuary of sorrow that pron1 be gaze at 

pron1 see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of person1 and the true life of the artist   and pron1 take a keen pleasure in the reflection pron1 long before sorrow have make pron1 day pron1 own and bind pron1 to pron1 wheel pron1 have write in the soul of man that pron1 pron1 would lead a person1 like life must be entirely and absolutely pron1 and have take as pron1 type not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in pron1 cell but also the painter to pron1 the world be a pageant and the poet for pron1 the world be a song   pron1 remember say once to andré gide as pron1 sit together in some person1 café that while meta physics have but little real interest for pron1 and morality absolutely none pron1 be pron1 that either person1 or person1 have say that could not be transfer immediately into the sphere of art and pron1 find pron1 complete fulfilment 

nor be pron1 merely that pron1 can discern in person1 that close union of personality with perfection which form the real distinction between the classical and romantic movement in life but the very basis of pron1 nature be the same as that of the nature of the artist an intense and flamelike imagination   pron1 realise in the entire sphere of human relation that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of art be the sole secret of creation   pron1 understand the leprosy of the leper the darkness of the blind the fierce misery of those pron1 live for pleasure the strange poverty of the rich   some one write to pron1 in trouble when pron1 be not on pron1 pedestal pron1 be not interesting   how remote be the writer from pron1 person1 person1 call person1 secret of person1   either would have teach pron1 that whatever happen to another happen to pron1 and if pron1 want an inscription to read at dawn and at night time and for pleasure or for pain write up on the wall of pron1 house in letter for the sun to person1 and the moon to silver whatever happen to pron1 happen to another   

person1 be place indeed be with the poet   pron1 whole conception of humanity spring right out of the imagination and can only be realise by pron1   pron1 person1 be to the pantheist man be to pron1   pron1 be the first to conceive the divide race as a unity   before pron1 time pron1 have be god and man and feel through the mysticism of sympathy that in pron1 each have be make incarnate pron1 call pron1 the son of the ordinal1 or the son of the other accord to pron1 mood   more than any one else in history pron1 wake in pron1 that temper of wonder to which romance always appeal   pron1 be still pron1 to pron1 almost incredible in the idea of a young person1 peasant imagine that pron1 could bear on pron1 own shoulder the burden of the entire world   all pron1 have already be do and suffer and all pron1 be yet to be do and suffer the sin of person1 of person1 person1 of person1 person1   and of pron1 pron1 be emperor of person1 and priest of the sun the suffering of those whose name be legion and whose dwelling be among the tomb oppressed nationality factory child thieve people in prison outcast those pron1 be dumb under oppression and whose silence be hear only of person1   and not merely imagine this but actually achieve pron1 so that at the present moment all pron1 come in contact with pron1 personality even though pron1 may neither bow to pron1 altar nor kneel before pron1 priest in some way find that the ugliness of pron1 sin be take away and the beauty of pron1 sorrow reveal to pron1 

pron1 have say of person1 that pron1 rank with the poet   that be true   person1 and sophocle be of pron1 company   but pron1 entire life also be the most wonderful of poem   for pity and terror pron1 be pron1 in the entire cycle of greek tragedy to touch pron1   the absolute purity of the protagonist raise the entire scheme to a height of romantic art from which the suffering of thebe and pelop line be by pron1 very horror exclude and show how wrong person1 be when pron1 say in pron1 treatise on the drama pron1 pron1 would be impossible to bear the spectacle of ordinal1 blameless in pain   nor in person1 nor person1 those stern master of tenderness in shakespeare the most purely human of all the great artist in the whole of celtic myth and legend where the loveliness of the world be show through a mist of tear and the life of a man be no more than the life of a flower be pron1 pron1 pron1 for sheer simplicity of pathos wed and make ordinal1 with sublimity of tragic effect can be say to equal or even approach the last act of person1 be passion   the little supper with pron1 companion ordinal1 of pron1 have already sell pron1 for a price   the anguish in the quiet moon light garden   the false friend come close to pron1 so as to betray pron1 with a kiss   the friend pron1 still believe in pron1 and on pron1 as on a rock pron1 have hope to build a house of refuge for man deny pron1 as the bird cry to the dawn   pron1 own utter loneliness pron1 submission pron1 acceptance of pron1   and along with pron1 all such scene as the high priest of person1 rend pron1 raiment in wrath and the magistrate of civil justice call for water in the vain hope of cleanse pron1 of that stain of innocent blood pron1 make pron1 the scarlet figure of history   the coronation ceremony of sorrow ordinal1 of the most wonderful thing in the whole of recorded time   the crucifixion of the innocent ordinal1 before the eye of pron1 mother and of the disciple pron1 pron1 love   the soldier gamble and throw dice for pron1 clothe   the terrible death by which pron1 give the world pron1 most eternal symbol   and pron1 final burial in the tomb of the rich man pron1 body swathe in egyptian linen with costly spice and perfume as though pron1 have be a king be son   when pron1 contemplate all this from the point of view of art alone pron1 can not but be grateful that the person1 person1 of the church should be the playing of the tragedy without the shedding of blood the mystical presentation by mean of dialogue and costume and gesture even of the passion of pron1 person1   and pron1 be always a source of pleasure and awe to pron1 to remember that the ultimate survival of the greek chorus lose elsewhere to art be to be find in the servitor answer the priest at mass 

yet the whole life of person1 so entirely may sorrow and beauty be make ordinal1 in pron1 meaning and manifestation be really an idyll though pron1 end with the veil of the temple be rent and the darkness come over the face of the earth and the stone roll to the door of the person1   ordinal1 always think of pron1 as a young bridegroom with pron1 companion as indeed pron1 somewhere describe pron1   as a shepherd stray through a valley with pron1 sheep in search of green meadow or cool stream   as a singer try to build out of the music the wall of the city of person1   or as a lover for whose love the whole world be too small   pron1 miracle seem to pron1 to be as exquisite as the coming of spring and quite as natural   pron1 see no difficulty at all in believe that such be the charm of pron1 personality that pron1 mere presence could bring peace to soul in anguish and that those pron1 touch pron1 garment or pron1 hand forget pron1 pain   or that as pron1 pass by on the highway of life people pron1 have see pron1 of life be mystery see pron1 clearly and other pron1 have be deaf to every voice but that of pleasure hear for the first time the voice of love and find pron1 as amusical as person1 be lute     or that evil passion flee at pron1 approach and man whose dull unimaginative life have be but a mode of death rise as pron1 be from the grave when pron1 call pron1   or that when pron1 teach on the hillside the multitude forget pron1 hunger and thirst and the care of this world and that to pron1 friend pron1 listen to pron1 as pron1 sit at meat the coarse food seem delicate and the water have the taste of good wine and the whole house become full of the odour and sweetness of person1 

person1 in pron1 person1 person1 person1 that gracious fifth gospel the gospel accord to person1   person1 pron1 might call pron1 say somewhere that person1 be great achievement be that pron1 make pron1 as much love after pron1 death as pron1 have be during pron1 lifetime   and certainly if pron1 place be among the poet pron1 be the leader of all the lover   pron1 see that love be the first secret of the world for which the wise man have be look and that pron1 be only through love that pron1 could approach either the heart of the leper or the foot of person1 

and above all person1 be the most supreme of individualist   person1 like the artistic acceptance of all experience be merely a mode of manifestation   pron1 be man be soul pron1 person1 be always look for   pron1 call pron1 person1 be kingdom and find pron1 in every one   pron1 compare pron1 to little thing to a tiny seed to a handful of leaven to a pearl   that be because pron1 realise one be soul only by get rid of all alien passion all acquire culture and all external possession be pron1 good or evil 

pron1 bear up against pron1 with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature till pron1 have absolutely pron1 leave in the world but ordinal1 thing   pron1 have lose pron1 name pron1 position pron1 happiness pron1 freedom pron1 wealth   pron1 be a prisoner and a pauper   but pron1 still have pron1 child leave   suddenly pron1 be take away from pron1 by the law   pron1 be a blow so appalling that pron1 do not know pron1 to do so pron1 fling pron1 on pron1 knee and bow pron1 head and weep and say the body of a child be as the body of the person1 pron1 be not worthy of either   that moment seem to save pron1   pron1 see then that the only thing for pron1 be to accept pron1   since then curious as pron1 will no doubt sound pron1 have be happy   pron1 be of course pron1 soul in pron1 ultimate essence pron1 pron1 have reach   in many way pron1 have be pron1 enemy but pron1 find pron1 wait for pron1 as a friend   when one come in contact with the soul pron1 make ordinal1 simple as a child as person1 say pron1 should be 

pron1 be tragic how few people ever possess pron1 soul before pron1 die   pron1 be more rare in any man say person1 person1 an act of pron1 own   pron1 be quite true   most people be other people   pron1 thought be some one else be opinion pron1 life a mimicry pron1 passion a quotation   person1 be not merely the person1 person1 but pron1 be the first individualist in history   people have try to make pron1 out an ordinary philanthropist or rank pron1 as an altruist with the scientific and sentimental   but pron1 be really neither ordinal1 nor the other   pity pron1 have of course for the poor for those pron1 be shut up in prison for the lowly for the wretched   but pron1 have far more pity for the rich for the hard hedonist for those pron1 waste pron1 freedom in become slave to thing for those pron1 wear soft raiment and live in king house   rich and pleasure seem to pron1 to be really great tragedy than poverty or sorrow   and as for altruism pron1 know well than pron1 that pron1 be vocation not volition pron1 determine pron1 and that one can not gather grape of thorn or fig from thistle 

to live for other as a definite self conscious aim be not pron1 creed   pron1 be not the basis of pron1 creed   when pron1 say forgive pron1 enemy pron1 be not for the sake of the enemy but for ordinal1 be own sake that pron1 say so and because love be more beautiful than hate   in pron1 own entreaty to the young man sell all pron1 person1 hast and give to the poor pron1 be not of the state of the poor that pron1 be think but of the soul of the young man the soul pron1 wealth be mar   in pron1 view of life pron1 be ordinal1 with the artist pron1 know that by the inevitable law of self perfection the poet must sing and the sculptor think in bronze and the painter make the world a mirror for pron1 mood as surely and as certainly as the hawthorn must blossom in spring and the corn turn to gold at harvest time and the moon in pron1 order wandering change from shield to sickle and from sickle to shield 

but while person1 do not say to man live for other pron1 point out that pron1 be no difference at all between the life of other and pron1 be own life   by this mean pron1 give to man an extended a titan personality   since pron1 come the history of each separate individual be or can be make the history of the world   of course culture have intensify the personality of man   art have make pron1 myriad minded   those pron1 have the artistic temperament go into exile with person1 and learn how salt be the bread of other and how steep pron1 stair   pron1 catch for a moment the serenity and calm of goethe and yet know but too well pron1 baudelaire cry to person1 


out of shakespeare be sonnet pron1 draw to pron1 own hurt pron1 may be the secret of pron1 love and make pron1 pron1 own   pron1 look with new eye on modern life because pron1 have listen to ordinal1 of person1 be person1 or handle greek thing or read the story of the passion of some dead man for some dead woman whose hair be like thread of fine gold and whose mouth be as a pomegranate   but the sympathy of the artistic temperament be necessarily with pron1 have find expression   in word or in colour in music or in marble behind the paint mask of an æschylean play or through some sicilian shepherd pierce and jointed reed the man and pron1 message must have be reveal 

to the artist expression be the only mode under which pron1 can conceive life at all   to pron1 pron1 be dumb be dead   but to person1 pron1 be not so   with a width and wonder of imagination pron1 fill ordinal1 almost with awe pron1 take the entire world of the inarticulate the voiceless world of pain as pron1 kingdom and make of pron1 pron1 eternal mouthpiece   those of pron1 pron1 have speak pron1 be dumb under oppression and whose silence be hear only of person1 pron1 choose as pron1 brother   pron1 seek to become eye to the blind ear to the deaf and a cry in the lip of those whose tongue have be tie   pron1 desire be to be to the myriad pron1 have find no utterance a very trumpet through which pron1 might call to person1   and feel with the artistic nature of ordinal1 to pron1 suffering and sorrow be mode through which pron1 could realise pron1 conception of the beautiful that an idea be of no value till pron1 become incarnate and be make an image pron1 make of pron1 the image of the man of sorrow and as such have fascinate and dominate art as no greek person1 ever succeed in do 

for the greek god in spite of the white and red of pron1 fair fleet limb be not really pron1 pron1 appear to be   the curved brow of person1 be like the sun be disc crescent over a hill at dawn and pron1 foot be as the wing of the morning but pron1 pron1 have be cruel to marsyas and have make niobe childless   in the steel shield of person1 be eye there have be no pity for person1   the pomp and peacock of person1 be all pron1 be really noble about pron1   and the father of the god pron1 have be too fond of the daughter of man   the ordinal1 most deeply suggestive figure of person1 mythology be for religion demeter an earth goddess not ordinal1 of the olympian and for art person1 the son of a mortal woman to pron1 the moment of pron1 birth have prove also the moment of pron1 death 

but life pron1 from pron1 lowly and most humble sphere produce ordinal1 far more marvellous than the mother of person1 or the son of semele   out of the carpenter be shop at person1 have come a personality infinitely great than any make by myth and legend and ordinal1 strangely enough destine to reveal to the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real beauty of the lily of the field as none either on cithaeron or at person1 have ever do 

the song of person1 pron1 be despise and reject of man a man of sorrow and acquaint with grief and pron1 hide as pron1 be pron1 face from pron1 have seem to pron1 to prefigure pron1 and in pron1 the prophecy be fulfil   pron1 must not be afraid of such a phrase   every single work of art be the fulfilment of a prophecy for every work of art be the conversion of an idea into an image   every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal either in the mind of person1 or in the mind of man   person1 find the type and fix pron1 and the dream of a virgilian poet either at person1 or at person1 become in the long progress of the century incarnate in pron1 for pron1 the world be wait 

to pron1 ordinal1 of the thing in history the most to be regret be that the person1 be own renaissance which have produce the cathedral at chartre the arthurian cycle of legend the life of person1   person1 of person1 the art of giotto and person1 be divine comedy be not allow to develop on pron1 own line but be interrupt and spoil by the dreary classical renaissance pron1 give pron1 person1 and person1 be fresco and palladian architecture and formal french tragedy and person1   person1 be cathedral and person1 be poetry and pron1 pron1 be make from without and by dead rule and do not spring from within through some spirit inform pron1   but wherever pron1 be a romantic movement in art there somehow and under some form be person1 or the soul of person1   pron1 be in person1 and person1 in the winter be tale in provençal poetry in the ancient mariner in la person1 person1 person1 person1 and in person1 be ballad of charity 

pron1 owe to pron1 the most diverse thing and people   person1 be les misérables baudelaire be person1 du person1 the note of pity in russian novel person1 and person1 be poem the stain glass and tapestry and the quattro person1 work of person1 person1 and person1 belong to pron1 no less than the tower of giotto person1 and person1 person1 the troubled romantic marble of person1 person1 point architecture and the love of child and flower for both of which indeed in classical art pron1 be but little place hardly enough for pron1 to grow or play in but which from the twelfth century down to pron1 own day have be continually make pron1 appearance in art under various mode and at various time come fitfully and wilfully as child as flower be apt to do spring always seem to ordinal1 as if the flower have be in hiding and only come out into the sun because pron1 be afraid that grow up people would grow tired of look for pron1 and give up the search   and the life of a child be no more than an person1 day on which pron1 be both rain and sun for the narcissus 

pron1 be the imaginative quality of person1 be own nature pron1 make pron1 this palpitate centre of romance   the strange figure of poetic drama and ballad be make by the imagination of other but out of pron1 own imagination entirely do person1 of person1 create pron1   the cry of person1 have really no more to do with pron1 coming than the song of the nightingale have to do with the rise of the moon no more though perhaps no less   pron1 be the denial as well as the affirmation of prophecy   for every expectation that pron1 fulfil there be another that pron1 destroy   in all beauty say bacon person1 be some strangeness of proportion and of those pron1 be bear of the spirit of those pron1 be to say pron1 like pron1 be dynamic force person1 say that pron1 be like the wind pron1 person1 where pron1 listeth and no man can tell whence pron1 cometh and pron1 pron1 goeth   that be why pron1 be so fascinating to artist   pron1 have all the colour element of life mystery strangeness pathos suggestion ecstasy love   pron1 appeal to the temper of wonder and create that mood in which alone pron1 can be understand 

and to pron1 pron1 be a joy to remember that if pron1 be of imagination all compact the world pron1 be of the same substance   pron1 say in dorian gray that the great sin of the world take place in the brain but pron1 be in the brain pron1 pron1 take place   pron1 know now that pron1 do not see with the eye or hear with the ear   pron1 be really channel for the transmission adequate or inadequate of sense impression   pron1 be in the brain pron1 the poppy be red that the apple be odorous that the skylark sing 

of late pron1 have be study with diligence the ordinal1 prose poem about person1   at person1 pron1 manage to get hold of a greek testament and every morning after pron1 have clean pron1 cell and polish pron1 tin pron1 read a little of the gospel a dozen verse take by chance anywhere   pron1 be a delightful way of open the day   every one even in a turbulent ill discipline life should do the same   endless repetition in and out of season have spoil for pron1 the freshness the naïveté the simple romantic charm of the gospel   pron1 hear pron1 read far too often and far too badly and all repetition be anti spiritual   when ordinal1 return to the greek   pron1 be like go into a garden of lily out of some narrow and dark house 

and to pron1 the pleasure be double by the reflection that pron1 be extremely probable that pron1 have the actual term the person1 verba use by person1   pron1 be always suppose that person1 talk in person1   even person1 think so   but now pron1 know that the person1 peasant like the irish peasant of pron1 own day be bilingual and that greek be the ordinary language of intercourse all over person1 as indeed all over the eastern world   pron1 never like the idea that pron1 know of person1 be own word only through a translation of a translation   pron1 be a delight to pron1 to think that as far as pron1 conversation be concern charmide might have listen to pron1 and socrate reason with pron1 and plato understand pron1 that pron1 really say that when pron1 think of the lily of the field and how pron1 neither toil nor spin pron1 absolute expression be and that pron1 last word when pron1 cry out amy life have be complete have reach pron1 fulfilment have be perfect be exactly as person1   person1 tell pron1 pron1 be no more 

while in read the gospel particularly that of person1   person1 pron1 or whatever early gnostic take pron1 name and person1 pron1 see the continual assertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material life pron1 see also that to person1 person1 be simply a form of love and that to pron1 love be person1 in the full meaning of the phrase   some ordinal1 week ago pron1 be allow by the doctor to have white bread to eat instead of the coarse black or brown bread of ordinary prison fare   pron1 be a great delicacy   pron1 will sound strange that dry bread could possibly be a delicacy to any one   to pron1 pron1 be so much so that at the close of each meal pron1 carefully eat whatever crumb may be leave on pron1 tin plate or have fall on the rough towel that pron1 use as a cloth so as not to soil ordinal1 be table   and pron1 do so not from hunger pron1 get now quite sufficient food but simply in order that pron1 should be waste of pron1 be give to pron1   so pron1 should look on love 

person1 like all fascinating personality have the power of not merely say beautiful thing pron1 but of make other people say beautiful thing to pron1   and pron1 love the story person1   person1 tell pron1 about the greek woman pron1 when as a trial of pron1 faith pron1 say to pron1 that pron1 could not give pron1 the bread of the child of person1 answer pron1 that the little dog little dog pron1 should be render pron1 be under the table eat of the crumb pron1 the child let fall   most people live for love and admiration   but pron1 be by love and admiration that pron1 should live   if any love be show pron1 pron1 should recognise that pron1 be quite unworthy of pron1   pron1 be worthy to be love   the fact that person1 love man show pron1 that in the divine order of ideal thing pron1 be write that eternal love be to be give to pron1 be eternally unworthy   or if that phrase seem to be a bitter one to bear let pron1 say that every one be worthy of love except pron1 pron1 think that pron1 be   person1 be a sacrament pron1 should be take kneeling and domine non sum person1 should be on the lip and in the heart of those pron1 receive pron1 

if ever pron1 write again in the sense of produce artistic work pron1 be just ordinal1 subject on which and through which pron1 desire to express pron1 ordinal1 be person1 as the precursor of the romantic movement in life the other be the artistic life consider in pron1 relation to conduct   the first be of course intensely fascinating for pron1 see in person1 not merely the essential of the person1 romantic type but all the accident the wilfulness even of the romantic temperament also   pron1 be the first person pron1 ever say to people that pron1 should live flower like life   pron1 fix the phrase   pron1 take child as the type of pron1 people should try to become   pron1 hold pron1 up as example to pron1 elder which pron1 pron1 have always think the chief use of child if pron1 be perfect should have a use   person1 describe the soul of a man as come from the hand of person1 weep and laugh like a little child and person1 also see that the soul of each one should be a guisa person1 person1 person1 person1 person1 person1 person1   pron1 feel that life be changeful fluid active and that to allow pron1 to be stereotype into any form be death   pron1 see that people should not be too serious over material common interest pron1 to be unpractical be to be a great thing pron1 pron1 should not bother too much over affair   the bird do not why should man   pron1 be charming when pron1 say take no thought for the morrow   be not the soul more than meat   be not the body more than raiment   a greek might have use the latter phrase   pron1 be full of greek feeling   but only person1 could have say both and so sum up life perfectly for pron1 

pron1 morality be all sympathy just what morality should be   if the only thing pron1 pron1 ever say have be pron1 sin be forgive pron1 because pron1 love much pron1 would have be worth while die to have say pron1   pron1 justice be all poetical justice exactly pron1 justice should be   the beggar go to person1 because pron1 have be unhappy   pron1 can not conceive a well reason for pron1 be send there   the people pron1 work for an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as those pron1 have toil there all day long in the hot sun   why should not pron1   probably no one deserve pron1   or perhaps pron1 be a different kind of people   person1 have no patience with the dull lifeless mechanical system pron1 treat people as if pron1 be thing and so treat pron1 alike for pron1 pron1 be no law pron1 be exception merely as if pron1 or pron1 for that matter be like aught else in the world 

that which be the very keynote of romantic art be to pron1 the proper basis of natural life   pron1 see no other basis   and when pron1 bring pron1 ordinal1 take in the very act of sin and show pron1 pron1 sentence write in the law and ask pron1 pron1 be to be do pron1 write with pron1 finger on the ground as though pron1 do not hear pron1 and finally when pron1 press pron1 again look up and say let pron1 of pron1 pron1 have never sin be the first to throw the stone at pron1   pron1 be worth while live to have say that 

like all poetical nature pron1 love ignorant people   pron1 know that in the soul of ordinal1 pron1 be ignorant pron1 be always room for a great idea   but pron1 could not stand stupid people especially those pron1 be make stupid by education people pron1 be full of opinion not ordinal1 of which pron1 even understand a peculiarly modern type sum up by person1 when pron1 describe pron1 as the type of ordinal1 pron1 have the key of knowledge can not use pron1 pron1 and do not allow other people to use pron1 though pron1 may be make to open the gate of person1 be kingdom   pron1 chief war be against the person1   that be the war every child of light have to wage   person1 be the note of the age and community in which pron1 live   in pron1 heavy inaccessibility to idea pron1 dull respectability pron1 tedious orthodoxy pron1 worship of vulgar success pron1 entire preoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life and pron1 ridiculous estimate of pron1 and pron1 importance the person1 of person1 in person1 be day be the exact counterpart of the person1 person1 of pron1 own   person1 mock at the whited sepulchre of respectability and fix that phrase for ever   pron1 treat worldly success as a thing absolutely to be despise   pron1 see pron1 in pron1 at all   pron1 look on wealth as an encumbrance to a man   pron1 would not hear of life be sacrifice to any system of thought or moral   pron1 point out that form and ceremony be make for man not man for form and ceremony   pron1 take sabbatarianism as a type of the thing pron1 should be set at nought   the cold philanthropy the ostentatious public charity the tedious formalism so dear to the middle class mind pron1 expose with utter and relentless scorn   to pron1 pron1 be term orthodoxy be merely a facile unintelligent acquiescence   but to pron1 and in pron1 hand pron1 be a terrible and paralyse tyranny   person1 sweep pron1 aside   pron1 show that the spirit alone be of value   pron1 take a keen pleasure in point out to pron1 that though pron1 be always read the law and the prophet pron1 have not really the small idea of pron1 either of pron1 mean   in opposition to pron1 tithing of each separate day into the fix routine of prescribe duty as pron1 person1 person1 and person1 pron1 preach the enormous importance of live completely for the moment 

those pron1 pron1 save from pron1 sin be save simply for beautiful moment in pron1 life   person1 person1 when pron1 see person1 break the rich vase of alabaster that ordinal1 of pron1 ordinal1 lover have give pron1 and spill the odorous spice over pron1 tired dusty foot and for that ordinal1 moment be sake sit for ever with person1 and person1 in the tress of the snow person1 rise of person1   all pron1 person1 say to pron1 by the way of a little warning be that every moment should be beautiful that the soul should always be ready for the coming of the bridegroom always wait for the voice of the lover philistinism be simply that side of man be nature pron1 be not illumine by the imagination   pron1 see all the lovely influence of life as mode of light the imagination pron1 be the world of light   the world be make by pron1 and yet the world can not understand pron1 that be because the imagination be simply a manifestation of love and pron1 be love and the capacity for pron1 pron1 distinguish ordinal1 human be from another 

but pron1 be when pron1 deal with a sinner pron1 person1 be most romantic in the sense of most real   the world have always love the saint as be the near possible approach to the perfection of person1   person1 through some divine instinct in pron1 seem to have always love the sinner as be the near possible approach to the perfection of man   pron1 primary desire be not to reform people any more than pron1 primary desire be to a relieve suffering   to turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man be not pron1 aim   pron1 would have think little of the prisoner aid society and other modern movement of the kind   the conversion of a publican into a pharisee would not have seem to pron1 a great achievement   but in a manner not yet understand of the world pron1 regard sin and suffering as be in pron1 beautiful holy thing and mode of perfection 

pron1 seem a very dangerous idea   pron1 be all great idea be dangerous   that pron1 be person1 be cree admit of no doubt   that pron1 be the true creed pron1 do not doubt pron1 

of course the sinner must repent   but why   simply because otherwise pron1 would be unable to realise pron1 pron1 have do   the moment of repentance be the moment of initiation   more than that pron1 be the mean by which pron1 alter ordinal1 be past   the person1 think that impossible   pron1 often say in pron1 gnomic aphorism even the god can not alter the past   person1 show that the common sinner could do pron1 that pron1 be the ordinal1 thing pron1 could do   person1 have pron1 be ask would have say pron1 feel quite certain about pron1 that the moment the prodigal son fall on pron1 knee and weep pron1 make pron1 have waste pron1 substance with harlot pron1 swine herd and hunger for the husk pron1 eat beautiful and holy moment in pron1 life   pron1 be difficult for most people to grasp the idea   pron1 dare say pron1 have to go to prison to understand pron1   if so pron1 may be worth while go to prison 

pron1 be pron1 so unique about person1   of course just as pron1 be false dawn before the dawn pron1 and winter day so full of sudden sunlight that pron1 will cheat the wise crocus into squander pron1 gold before pron1 time and make some foolish bird call to pron1 mate to build on barren bough so pron1 be person1 before person1   for that pron1 should be grateful   the unfortunate thing be that pron1 have be none since   pron1 make ordinal1 exception person1   person1 of assisi   but then person1 have give pron1 at pron1 birth the soul of a poet as pron1 pron1 when quite young have in mystical marriage take poverty as pron1 bride and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar pron1 find the way to perfection not difficult   pron1 understand person1 and so pron1 become like pron1   pron1 do not require the person1 person1 to teach pron1 that the life of person1   person1 be the true imitatio person1 a poem compare to which the book of that name be merely prose 

indeed that be the charm about person1 when all be say pron1 be just like a work of art   pron1 do not really teach ordinal1 pron1 but by be bring into pron1 presence one become pron1   and pron1 be predestine to pron1 presence   once at least in pron1 life each man walk with person1 to person1 

as regard the other subject the relation of the artistic life to conduct pron1 will no doubt seem strange to pron1 that pron1 should select pron1   people point to read gaol and say that be where the artistic life lead a man   well pron1 might lead to bad place   the more mechanical people to pron1 life be a shrewd speculation depend on a careful calculation of way and mean always know where pron1 be go and go there   pron1 start with the ideal desire of be the parish beadle and in whatever sphere pron1 be place pron1 succeed in be the parish beadle and no more   a man whose desire be to be pron1 separate from pron1 to be a member of parliament or a successful grocer or a prominent solicitor or a judge or pron1 equally tedious invariably succeed in be pron1 pron1 want to be   that be pron1 punishment   those pron1 want a mask have to wear pron1 

but with the dynamic force of life and those in pron1 those dynamic force become incarnate pron1 be different   people whose desire be solely for self realisation never know where pron1 be go   pron1 can not know   in ordinal1 sense of the word pron1 be of course necessary as the person1 person1 say to know pron1 pron1 be the first achievement of knowledge   but to recognise that the soul of a man be unknowable be the ultimate achievement of wisdom   the final mystery be pron1   when pron1 have weigh the sun in the balance and measure the step of the moon and map out the ordinal1 person1 star by star pron1 still remain pron1   pron1 can calculate the orbit of pron1 own soul   when the son go out to look for pron1 father be ass pron1 do not know that a man of person1 be wait for pron1 with the very chrism of coronation and that pron1 own soul be already the soul of a king 

pron1 hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character pron1 pron1 shall be able at the end of pron1 day to say yes   this be just where the artistic life lead a man   ordinal1 of the most perfect life pron1 have come across in pron1 own experience be the life of person1 and of person1 person1 both of pron1 man pron1 have pass year in prison the first the ordinal1 person1 poet since person1   the other a man with a soul of that beautiful person1 person1 which seem come out of person1   and for the last ordinal1 or ordinal1 month in spite of a succession of great trouble reach pron1 from the outside world almost without intermission pron1 have be place in direct contact with a new spirit work in this prison through man and thing pron1 have help pron1 beyond any possibility of expression in word so that while for the first year of pron1 imprisonment pron1 do pron1 else and can remember do pron1 else but wring pron1 hand in impotent despair and say pron1 an end pron1 an appalling ending   now pron1 try to say to pron1 and sometimes when pron1 be not torture pron1 do really and sincerely say pron1 a begin pron1 a wonderful beginning   pron1 may really be so   pron1 may become so   if pron1 do pron1 shall owe much to this new personality pron1 have alter every man be life in this place 

pron1 may realise pron1 when pron1 say that have pron1 be release last person1 as pron1 try to be pron1 would have leave this place loathe pron1 and every official in pron1 with a bitterness of hatred pron1 would have poison pron1 life   pron1 have have a year long of imprisonment but humanity have be in the prison along with pron1 all and now when pron1 go out pron1 shall always remember great kindness pron1 pron1 have receive here from almost pron1 and on the day of pron1 release pron1 shall give many thank to many people and ask to be remember by pron1 in turn 

the prison style be absolutely and entirely wrong   pron1 would give pron1 to be able to alter pron1 when pron1 go out   pron1 intend to try   but pron1 be pron1 in the world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity which be the spirit of love the spirit of the person1 pron1 be not in church may make pron1 if not right at least possible to be bear without too much bitterness of heart 

pron1 know also that much be wait for pron1 outside that be very delightful from pron1 person1   person1 of person1 call person1 brother the wind and pron1 sister the rain lovely thing both of pron1 down to the shop window and sunset of great city   if pron1 make a list of all pron1 still remain to pron1 pron1 do not know where pron1 should stop for indeed person1 make the world just as much for pron1 as for any one else   perhaps pron1 may go out with pron1 pron1 pron1 have not get before   pron1 need not tell pron1 that to pron1 reformation in moral be as meaningless and vulgar as reformation in theology   but while to propose to be a well man be a piece of unscientific can not to have become a deep man be the privilege of those pron1 have suffer   and such pron1 think pron1 have become 

if after pron1 be free a friend of mine give a feast and do not invite pron1 to pron1 pron1 should not mind a bit   pron1 can be perfectly happy by pron1   with freedom flower book and the moon pron1 could not be perfectly happy   besides feast be not for pron1 any more   pron1 have give too many to care about pron1   that side of life be over for pron1 very fortunately pron1 dare say   but if after pron1 be free a friend of mine have a sorrow and refuse to allow pron1 to share pron1 pron1 should feel pron1 most bitterly   if pron1 shut the door of the house of mourn against pron1 pron1 would come back again and again and beg to be admit so that pron1 might share in pron1 pron1 be entitle to share in   if pron1 think pron1 unworthy unfit to weep with pron1 pron1 should feel pron1 as the most poignant humiliation as the most terrible mode in which disgrace could be inflict on pron1   but that could not be   pron1 have a right to share in sorrow and pron1 pron1 can look at the loveliness of the world and share pron1 sorrow and realise pron1 of the wonder of both be in immediate contact with divine thing and have get as near to person1 be secret as any one can get 

perhaps pron1 may come into pron1 art also no less than into pron1 life a still deep note ordinal1 of great unity of passion and directness of impulse   not width but intensity be the true aim of modern art   pron1 be no long in art concern with the type   pron1 be with the exception pron1 pron1 have to do   pron1 can not put pron1 suffering into any form pron1 take pron1 need hardly say   art only begin where imitation end but pron1 must come into pron1 work of full memory of word perhaps of rich cadence of more curious effect of simple architectural order of some aesthetic quality at any rate 

when person1 be notorn from the scabbard of pron1 limb person1 person1 person1 person1 sue to use ordinal1 of person1 be most terrible tacitean phrase pron1 have no more song the person1 say   person1 have be victor   the lyre have vanquish the reed   but perhaps the person1 be mistaken   pron1 hear in much modern art the cry of person1   pron1 be bitter in baudelaire sweet and plaintive in person1 person1 in person1   pron1 be in the deferred resolution of person1 be music   pron1 be in the discontent pron1 haunt person1 person1 be woman   even person1 person1 whose song of callicle tell of person1 triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre and the famous final victory in such a clear note of lyrical beauty have not a little of pron1   in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress pron1 haunt pron1 verse neither person1 nor wordsworth could help pron1 though pron1 follow each in turn and when pron1 seek to mourn for thyrsis or to sing of the scholar gipsy pron1 be the reed pron1 pron1 have to take for the rendering of pron1 strain   but whether or not the phrygian faun be silent pron1 can not be   expression be as necessary to pron1 as leaf and blossom be to the black branch of the tree pron1 show pron1 above the prison wall and be so restless in the wind   between pron1 art and the world pron1 be now a wide gulf but between art and pron1 pron1 be none   pron1 hope at least that pron1 be none 

to each of pron1 different fate be mete out   pron1 lot have be ordinal1 of public infamy of long imprisonment of misery of ruin of disgrace but pron1 be not worthy of pron1 not yet at any rate   pron1 remember that pron1 use to say that pron1 think pron1 could bear a real tragedy if pron1 come to pron1 with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow but that the dreadful thing about modernity be that pron1 put tragedy into the raiment of comedy so that the great reality seem commonplace or grotesque or lack in style   pron1 be quite true about modernity   pron1 have probably always be true about actual life   pron1 be say that all martyrdom seem mean to the looker on   the nineteenth century be no exception to the rule 

pron1 about pron1 tragedy have be hideous mean repellent lack in style   pron1 very dress make pron1 grotesque   pron1 be the zany of sorrow   pron1 be clown whose heart be break   pron1 be specially design to appeal to the sense of humour   on person1 13th ordinal1 pron1 be bring down here from person1   from ordinal1 o clock till half past ordinal1 on that day pron1 have to stand on the centre platform of person1 junction in convict dress and handcuff for the world to look at   pron1 have be take out of the hospital ward without a moment be notice be give to pron1   of all possible object pron1 be the most grotesque   when people see pron1 pron1 laugh   each train as pron1 come up swell the audience   pron1 could exceed pron1 amusement   that be of course before pron1 know pron1 pron1 be   as soon as pron1 have be inform pron1 laugh still more   for half an hour pron1 stand there in the person1 person1 rain surround by a jeer mob 

for a year after that be do to pron1 pron1 weep every day at the same hour and for the same space of time   that be not such a tragic thing as possibly pron1 sound to pron1   to those pron1 be in prison tear be a part of every day be experience   a day in prison on which pron1 do not weep be a day on which pron1 be heart be hard not a day on which pron1 be heart be happy 

well now pron1 be really begin to feel more regret for the people pron1 laugh than for pron1   of course when pron1 see pron1 pron1 be not on pron1 pedestal pron1 be in the pillory   but pron1 be a very unimaginative nature pron1 only care for people on pron1 pedestal   a pedestal may be a very unreal thing   a pillory be a terrific reality   pron1 should have know also how to interpret sorrow well   pron1 have say that behind sorrow pron1 be always sorrow   pron1 be wise still to say that behind sorrow pron1 be always a soul   and to mock at a soul in pain be a dreadful thing   in the strangely simple economy of the world people only get pron1 pron1 give and to those pron1 have not enough imagination to penetrate the mere outward of thing and feel pity what pity can be give save that of scorn 

pron1 write this account of the mode of pron1 be transfer here simply that pron1 should be realise how hard pron1 have be for pron1 to get pron1 out of pron1 punishment but bitterness and despair   pron1 have however to do pron1 and now and then pron1 have moment of submission and acceptance   all the spring may be hide in the single bud and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy pron1 be to herald the foot of many rise red dawn   so perhaps whatever beauty of life still remain to pron1 be contain in some moment of surrender abasement and humiliation   pron1 can at any rate merely proceed on the line of pron1 own development and accept all pron1 have happen to pron1 make pron1 worthy of pron1 

people use to say of pron1 that pron1 be too individualistic   pron1 must be far more of an individualist than ever pron1 be   pron1 must get far more out of pron1 than ever pron1 get and ask far less of the world than ever pron1 ask   indeed pron1 ruin come not from too great individualism of life but from too little   the ordinal1 disgraceful unpardonable and to all time contemptible action of pron1 life be to allow pron1 to appeal to society for help and protection   to have make such an appeal would have be from the individualist point of view bad enough but what excuse can pron1 ever be put forward for have make pron1   of course once pron1 have put into motion the force of society society turn on pron1 and say have pron1 be live all this time in defiance of pron1 law and do pron1 now appeal to those law for protection   pron1 shall have those law exercise to the full   pron1 shall abide by pron1 pron1 have appeal to   the result be pron1 be in gaol   certainly no man ever fall so ignobly and by such ignoble instrument as pron1 do 

the philistine element in life be not the failure to understand art   charming people such as fisherman shepherd ploughboy peasant and the like know pron1 about art and be the very salt of the earth   pron1 be the philistine pron1 uphold and aid the heavy cumbrous blind mechanical force of society and pron1 do not recognise dynamic force when pron1 meet pron1 either in a man or a movement 

people think pron1 dreadful of pron1 to have entertain at dinner the evil thing of life and to have find pleasure in pron1 company   but then from the point of view through which pron1 as an artist in life approach pron1 pron1 be delightfully suggestive and stimulating   the danger be half the excitement            pron1 business as an artist be with person1   pron1 set pron1 to wrestle with person1          

a great friend of mine a friend of ordinal1 year standing come to see pron1 some time ago and tell pron1 that pron1 do not believe a single word of pron1 be say against pron1 and wish pron1 to know that pron1 consider pron1 quite innocent and the victim of a hideous plot   pron1 burst into tear at pron1 pron1 say and tell pron1 that while pron1 be much amongst the definite charge pron1 be quite untrue and transfer to pron1 by revolt malice still that pron1 life have be full of perverse pleasure and that unless pron1 accept that as a fact about pron1 and realise pron1 to the full pron1 could not possibly be friend with pron1 any more or ever be in pron1 company   pron1 be a terrible shock to pron1 but pron1 be friend and pron1 have not get pron1 friendship on false pretence 

emotional force as pron1 say somewhere in intention be as limited in extent and duration as the force of physical energy   the little cup pron1 be make to hold so much can hold so much and no more though all the purple vat of burgundy be fill with wine to the brim and the treader stand knee deep in the gather grape of the stony vineyard of person1   pron1 be no error more common than that of think that those pron1 be the cause or occasion of great tragedy share in the feeling suitable to the tragic mood no error more fatal than expect pron1 of pron1   the martyr in pron1 ishirt of flame may be look on the face of person1 but to pron1 pron1 be pile the faggot or loosen the log for the blast the whole scene be no more than the slaying of an ox be to the butcher or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest or the fall of a flower to ordinal1 pron1 be mow down the grass with a scythe   great passion be for the great of soul and great event can be see only by those pron1 be on a level with pron1 

  

pron1 know of pron1 in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of art pron1 more suggestive in pron1 subtlety of observation than shakespeare be draw of person1 and person1   pron1 be hamlet be college friend   pron1 have be pron1 companion   pron1 bring with pron1 memory of pleasant day together   at the moment when pron1 come across pron1 in the play pron1 be staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to ordinal1 of pron1 temperament   the dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on pron1 a mission at once too great and too mean for pron1   pron1 be a dreamer and pron1 be call upon to act   pron1 have the nature of the poet and pron1 be ask to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect with life in pron1 practical realisation of which pron1 know pron1 not with life in pron1 ideal essence of which pron1 know so much   pron1 have no conception of pron1 to do and pron1 folly be to feign folly   person1 use madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of pron1 purpose the dagger of pron1 will but the hamlet madness be a mere mask for the hiding of weakness   in the making of fancy and jest pron1 see a chance of delay   pron1 keep play with action as an artist play with a theory   pron1 make pron1 the spy of pron1 proper action and listen to pron1 own word know pron1 to be but word word word   instead of try to be the hero of pron1 own history pron1 seek to be the spectator of pron1 own tragedy   pron1 disbelieve in pron1 include pron1 and yet pron1 doubt help pron1 not as pron1 come not from scepticism but from a divided will 

of all this guildenstern and person1 realise pron1   pron1 bow and smirk and smile and pron1 the one say the other echo with sickly intonation   when at last by mean of the play within the play and the puppet in pron1 dalliance hamlet catch the conscience of the king and drive the wretched man in terror from pron1 throne guildenstern and person1 see no more in pron1 conduct than a rather painful breach of court etiquette   that be as far as pron1 can attain to in person1 contemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotion   pron1 be close to pron1 very secret and know pron1 of pron1   nor would pron1 be any use in tell pron1   pron1 be the little cup pron1 can hold so much and no more   towards the close pron1 be suggest that catch in a cunning spring set for another pron1 have meet or may meet with a violent and sudden death   but a tragic ending of this kind though touch by hamlet be humour with pron1 of the surprise and justice of comedy be really not for such as pron1   pron1 never die   person1 pron1 in order to areport hamlet and pron1 cause aright to the unsatisfied 

  absent pron1 from felicity a while 
and in this harsh world draw pron1 breath in pain 

die but guildenstern and person1 be as immortal as person1 and tartuffe and should rank with pron1   pron1 be pron1 modern life have contribute to the antique ideal of friendship   pron1 pron1 write a new de person1 must find a niche for pron1 and praise pron1 in person1 person1   pron1 be type fix for all time   to censure pron1 would show a lack of appreciation   pron1 be merely out of pron1 sphere pron1 be all   in sublimity of soul pron1 be no contagion   high thought and high emotion be by pron1 very existence isolated 

  

pron1 be to be release if all go well with pron1 towards the end of may and hope to go at once to some little sea side village abroad with r and m   

the sea as euripide say in ordinal1 of pron1 play about iphigeneia wash away the stain and wound of the world 

pron1 hope to be at least a month with pron1 friend and to gain peace and balance and a less troubled heart and a sweet mood   pron1 have a strange longing for the great simple primeval thing such as the sea to pron1 no less of a mother than the earth   pron1 seem to pron1 that pron1 all look at nature too much and live with pron1 too little   pron1 discern great sanity in the greek attitude   pron1 never chatter about sunset or discuss whether the shadow on the grass be really mauve or not   but pron1 see that the sea be for the swimmer and the sand for the foot of the runner   pron1 love the tree for the shadow that pron1 cast and the forest for pron1 silence at noon   the vineyard dresser wreathe pron1 hair with ivy pron1 pron1 might keep off the ray of the sun as pron1 stoop over the young shoot and for the artist and the athlete the ordinal1 type pron1 person1 give pron1 pron1 plait with garland the leave of the bitter laurel and of the wild parsley which else have be of no service to man 

pron1 call pron1 a utilitarian age and pron1 do not know the use of any single thing   pron1 have forget that water can cleanse and fire purify and that the earth be mother to pron1 all   as a consequence pron1 art be of the moon and play with shadow while greek art be of the sun and deal directly with thing   pron1 feel sure that in elemental force pron1 be purification and pron1 want to go back to pron1 and live in pron1 presence 

of course to ordinal1 so modern as pron1 be merely to look at the world will be always lovely   pron1 tremble with pleasure when pron1 think that on the very day of pron1 leave prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be bloom in the garden and that pron1 shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the sway gold of the one and make the other toss the pale purple of pron1 plume so that all the air shall be arabia for pron1   person1 fall on pron1 knee and weep for joy when pron1 see for the first time the long heath of some person1 upland make yellow with the person1 aromatic broom of the common furze   and pron1 know that for pron1 to pron1 flower be part of desire pron1 be tear wait in the petal of some rise   pron1 have always be so with pron1 from pron1 boyhood   pron1 be not a single colour hide away in the chalice of a flower or the curve of a shell to which by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of thing pron1 nature do not answer   like gautier pron1 have always be ordinal1 of those 

still pron1 be conscious now that behind all this beauty satisfy though pron1 may be pron1 be some spirit hide of which the paint form and shape be but mode of manifestation and pron1 be with this spirit pron1 pron1 desire to become in harmony   pron1 have grow tired of the articulate utterance of man and thing   the mystical in art the mystical in life the mystical in nature this be pron1 pron1 be look for   pron1 be absolutely necessary for pron1 to find pron1 somewhere 

all trial be trial for ordinal1 be life just as all sentence be sentence of death   and ordinal1 time have pron1 be try   the first time pron1 leave the box to be arrest the second time to be lead back to the house of detention the third time to pass into a prison for ordinal1 year   person1 as pron1 have constitute pron1 will have no place for pron1 have none to offer   but nature whose sweet rain fall on unjust and just alike will have cleft in the rock where pron1 may hide and secret valley in whose silence pron1 may weep undisturbed   pron1 will hang the night with star so that pron1 may walk abroad in the darkness without stumble and send the wind over pron1 footprint so that none may track pron1 to pron1 hurt pron1 will cleanse pron1 in great water and with bitter herb make pron1 whole
