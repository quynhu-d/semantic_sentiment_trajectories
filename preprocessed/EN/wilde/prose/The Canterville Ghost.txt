on reach a small secret chamber in the left wing pron1 lean up against a moonbeam to recover pron1 breath and begin to try and realize pron1 position   never in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of ordinal1 ordinal1 year have pron1 be so grossly insult   pron1 think of the dowager duchess pron1 pron1 have frighten into a fit as pron1 stand before the glass in pron1 lace and diamond   of the ordinal1 housemaid pron1 have go into hysteric when pron1 merely grin at pron1 through the curtain on ordinal1 of the spare bedroom   of the rector of the parish whose candle pron1 have blow out as pron1 be come late ordinal1 night from the library and pron1 have be under the care of person1 person1 person1 ever since a perfect martyr to nervous disorder   and of old person1 de person1 pron1 have waken up ordinal1 morning early and see a skeleton seat in an armchair by the fire read pron1 diary have be confine to pron1 bed for ordinal1 week with an attack of brain fever and on pron1 recovery have become reconcile to the church and break off pron1 connection with that notorious sceptic monsieur de voltaire   pron1 remember the terrible night when the wicked person1 person1 be find choke in pron1 dressing room with the knave of diamond half way down pron1 throat and confess just before pron1 die that pron1 have cheat person1 person1 person1 out of ordinal1 ordinal1 at person1 be by mean of that very card and swear that the ghost have make pron1 swallow pron1   all pron1 great achievement come back to pron1 again from the butler pron1 have shoot pron1 in the pantry because pron1 have see a green hand tap at the window pane to the beautiful lady person1 pron1 be always oblige to wear a black velvet band round pron1 throat to hide the mark of ordinal1 finger burn upon pron1 white skin and pron1 drown pron1 at last in the carp pond at the end of the king be walk   with the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist pron1 go over pron1 most celebrated performance and smile bitterly to pron1 as pron1 recall to mind pron1 last appearance as red person1 or the strangle babe pron1 début as guant gibeon the blood sucker of bexley moor and the furore pron1 have excite ordinal1 lovely person1 evening by merely play ninepin with pron1 own bone upon the lawn tennis ground   and after all this some wretched modern person1 be to come and offer pron1 the rise sun lubricator and throw pillow at pron1 head   pron1 be quite unbearable   besides no ghost in history have ever be treat in this manner   accordingly pron1 determine to have vengeance and remain till daylight in an attitude of deep thought 

iii 
the next morning when the person1 family meet at breakfast pron1 discuss the ghost at some length   the person1 person1 person1 be naturally a little annoyed to find that pron1 present have not be accept   pron1 have no wish pron1 say to do the ghost any personal injury and pron1 must say that consider the length of time pron1 have be in the house pron1 do not think pron1 be at all polite to throw pillow at pron1 a very just remark at which pron1 be sorry to say the twin burst into shout of laughter   upon the other hand pron1 continue if pron1 really decline to use the rise sun lubricator pron1 shall have to take pron1 chain from pron1   pron1 would be quite impossible to sleep with such a noise go on outside the bedroom

  the twin         at once discharge ordinal1 pellet on pron1 

on reach pron1 room pron1 entirely break down and become a prey to the most violent agitation   the vulgarity of the twin and the gross materialism of person1   person1 be naturally extremely annoying but pron1 really distress pron1 most be that pron1 have be unable to wear the suit of mail   pron1 have hope that even modern person1 would be thrill by the sight of a spectre in armour if for no more sensible reason at least out of respect for pron1 natural poet longfellow over whose graceful and attractive poetry pron1 pron1 have while away many a weary hour when the canterville be up in town   besides pron1 be pron1 own suit   pron1 have wear pron1 with great success at the person1 tournament and have be highly complimented on pron1 by no less a person than the person1 person1 pron1   yet when pron1 have put pron1 on pron1 have be completely overpower by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque and have fall heavily on the stone pavement bark both pron1 knee severely and bruise the knuckle of pron1 right hand 

for some day after this pron1 be extremely ill and hardly stir out of pron1 room at all except to keep the blood stain in proper repair   however by take great care of pron1 pron1 recover and resolve to make a third attempt to frighten the person1 person1 person1 and pron1 family   pron1 select person1 person1 17th for pron1 appearance and spend most of that day in look over pron1 wardrobe ultimately decide in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather a wind sheet frille at the wrist and neck and a rusty dagger   towards evening a violent storm of rain come on and the wind be so high that all the window and door in the old house shake and rattle   in fact pron1 be just such weather as pron1 love   pron1 plan of action be this   pron1 be to make pron1 way quietly to person1 otis be room gibber at pron1 from the foot of the bed and stab pron1 ordinal1 time in the throat to the sound of low music   pron1 bear person1 a special grudge be quite aware that pron1 be pron1 pron1 be in the habit of remove the famous canterville blood stain by mean of person1 be paragon detergent   have reduce the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror pron1 be then to proceed to the room occupy by the person1 person1 person1 and pron1 wife and there to place a clammy hand on person1   person1 be forehead while pron1 hiss into pron1 tremble husband be ear the awful secret of the person1 house   with regard to little person1 pron1 have not quite make up pron1 mind   pron1 have never insult pron1 in any way and be pretty and gentle   a few hollow groan from the wardrobe pron1 think would be more than sufficient or if that fail to wake pron1 pron1 might grabble at the counterpane with palsy twitch finger   as for the twin pron1 be quite determined to teach pron1 a lesson   the first thing to be do be of course to sit upon pron1 chest so as to produce the stifle sensation of nightmare   then as pron1 bed be quite close to each other to stand between pron1 in the form of a green icy cold corpse till pron1 become paralyzed with fear and finally to throw off the wind sheet and crawl round the room with white bleach bone and ordinal1 roll eyeball in the character of dumb person1 or the suicide be skeleton a rôle in which pron1 have on more than ordinal1 occasion produce a great effect and which pron1 consider quite equal to pron1 famous part of person1 the person1 or the mask mystery

v 
afew day after this person1 and pron1 curly haired cavalier go out ride on brockley meadow where pron1 tear pron1 habit so badly in get through a hedge pron1 on pron1 return home pron1 make up pron1 mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be see   as pron1 be run past the tapestry chamber the door of which happen to be open pron1 fancy pron1 see some ordinal1 inside and think pron1 be pron1 mother be maid pron1 sometimes use to bring pron1 work there look in to ask pron1 to mend pron1 habit   to pron1 immense surprise however pron1 be the person1 ghost pron1   pron1 be sit by the window watch the ruin gold of the yellow tree fly through the air and the red leave dance madly down the long avenue   pron1 head be lean on pron1 hand and pron1 whole attitude be ordinal1 of extreme depression   indeed so forlorn and so much out of repair do pron1 look that person1 person1 whose first idea have be to run away and lock pron1 in pron1 room be fill with pity and determine to try and comfort pron1   so light be pron1 footfall and so deep pron1 melancholy that pron1 be not aware of pron1 presence till pron1 speak to pron1 

  pron1 be so sorry for pron1 pron1 say but pron1 brother be go back to person1 to morrow and then if pron1 behave pron1 no one will annoy pron1   

  pron1 be absurd ask pron1 to behave pron1 pron1 answer look round in astonishment at the pretty little girl pron1 have venture to address pron1 quite absurd   pron1 must rattle pron1 chain and groan through keyhole and walk about at night if that be pron1 pron1 mean   pron1 be pron1 only reason for exist   

  pron1 be no reason at all for exist and pron1 know pron1 have be very wicked   person1   person1 tell pron1 the first day pron1 arrive here that pron1 have kill pron1 wife   

  well pron1 quite admit pron1 say the ghost petulantly but pron1 be a purely family matter and concern no one else   

  pron1 be very wrong to kill any one say person1 pron1 at time have a sweet puritan gravity catch from some old person1 person1 person1 

  oh pron1 hate the cheap severity of abstract ethic   pron1 wife be very plain never have pron1 ruff properly starch and know pron1 about cookery   why pron1 be a buck pron1 have shoot in hogley wood a magnificent pricket and do pron1 know how pron1 have pron1 send to table   however pron1 be no matter now for pron1 be all over and pron1 do not think pron1 be very nice of pron1 brother to starve pron1 to death though pron1 do kill pron1   

  starve pron1 to death   oh person1   person1 pron1 mean person1 person1 be pron1 hungry   pron1 have a sandwich in pron1 case   would pron1 like pron1   

  no thank pron1 pron1 never eat pron1 now   but pron1 be very kind of pron1 all the same and pron1 be much nice than the rest of pron1 horrid rude vulgar dishonest family   

  stop   cry person1 stamp pron1 foot pron1 be pron1 pron1 be rude and horrid and vulgar and as for dishonesty pron1 know pron1 steal the paint out of pron1 box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood stain in the library   first pron1 take all pron1 red include the vermilion and pron1 could not do any more sunset then pron1 take the person1 person1 and the chrome yellow and finally pron1 have pron1 leave but person1 and person1 white and could only do moonlight scene which be always depress to look at and not at all easy to paint   pron1 never tell on pron1 though pron1 be very much annoyed and pron1 be most ridiculous the whole thing   for pron1 ever hear of person1 person1 blood   

  well really say the ghost rather meekly pron1 be pron1 to do   pron1 be a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays and as pron1 brother begin pron1 all with pron1 paragon detergent pron1 certainly see no reason why pron1 should not have pron1 paint   as for colour pron1 be always a matter of taste the canterville have blue blood for instance the very bluest in person1   but pron1 know pron1 person1 do not care for thing of this kind   

  pron1 know pron1 about pron1 and the good thing pron1 can do be to emigrate and improve pron1 mind   pron1 father will be only too happy to give pron1 a free passage and though pron1 be a heavy duty on spirit of every kind pron1 will be no difficulty about the custom house as the officer be all person1   once in person1 person1 pron1 be sure to be a great success   pron1 know lot of people there pron1 would give a ordinal1 ordinal1 dollar to have a grandfather and much more than that to have a family ghost   

  pron1 do not think pron1 should like person1   

  pron1 suppose because pron1 have no ruin and no curiosity say person1 satirically 

  no ruin   no curiosity   answer the ghost   pron1 have pron1 navy and pron1 manner   

  good evening   pron1 will go and ask person1 to get the twin an extra week be holiday   

  please do not go miss person1 pron1 cry   pron1 be so lonely and so unhappy and pron1 really do not know pron1 to do   pron1 want to go to sleep and pron1 can not   

  pron1 be quite absurd   pron1 have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle   pron1 be very difficult sometimes to keep awake especially at church but pron1 be no difficulty at all about sleep   why even baby know how to do that and pron1 be not very clever   

  pron1 have not sleep for ordinal1 ordinal1 year pron1 say sadly and person1 be beautiful blue eye open in wonder   for ordinal1 ordinal1 year pron1 have not sleep and pron1 be so tired   

person1 grow quite grave and pron1 little lip tremble like rose leave   pron1 come towards pron1 and kneel down at pron1 side look up into pron1 old withered face 

  poor poor ghost pron1 murmur   have pron1 no place where pron1 can sleep   

  poor poor ghost pron1 murmur   have pron1 no place where pron1 can sleep   
  poor poor ghost pron1 murmur   have pron1 no place where pron1 can sleep   

  far away beyond the pine wood pron1 answer in a low dreamy voice pron1 be a little garden   there the grass grow long and deep pron1 be the great white star of the hemlock flower there the nightingale sing all night long   all night long pron1 sing and the person1 person1 moon look down and the yew tree spread out pron1 giant arm over the sleeper   

person1 be eye grow dim with tear and pron1 hide pron1 face in pron1 hand 

  pron1 mean the garden of death pron1 whisper 

  yes death   death must be so beautiful   to lie in the soft brown earth with the grass wave above ordinal1 be head and listen to silence   to have no yesterday and no to morrow   to forget time to forget life to be at peace   pron1 can help pron1   pron1 can open for pron1 the portal of death be house for love be always with pron1 and love be strong than death be   

person1 tremble a cold shudder run through pron1 and for a few moment pron1 be silence   pron1 feel as if pron1 be in a terrible dream 

then the ghost speak again and pron1 voice sound like the sighing of the wind 

  have pron1 ever read the old prophecy on the library window   

  oh often cry the little girl look up   pron1 know pron1 quite well   pron1 be paint in curious black letter and be difficult to read   pron1 be only ordinal1 line 

  when a golden girl can win 

prayer from out the lip of sin 

when the barren almond bear 

and a little child give away pron1 tear 

then shall all the house be still 

and peace come to person1   

but pron1 do not know pron1 pron1 mean   

  pron1 mean pron1 say sadly that pron1 must weep with pron1 for pron1 sin because pron1 have no tear and pray with pron1 for pron1 soul because pron1 have no faith and then if pron1 have always be sweet and good and gentle the angel of death will have mercy on pron1   pron1 will see fearful shape in darkness and wicked voice will whisper in pron1 ear but pron1 will not harm pron1 for against the purity of a little child the power of hell can not prevail   

person1 make no answer and the ghost wring pron1 hand in wild despair as pron1 look down at pron1 bow golden head   suddenly pron1 stand up very pale and with a strange light in pron1 eye   pron1 be not afraid pron1 say firmly and pron1 will ask the angel to have mercy on pron1   

pron1 rise from pron1 seat with a faint cry of joy and take pron1 hand bent over pron1 with old fashioned grace and kiss pron1   pron1 finger be as cold as ice and pron1 lip burn like fire but person1 do not falter as pron1 lead pron1 across the dusky room   on the faded green tapestry be broidered little huntsman   pron1 blow pron1 tassel horn and with pron1 tiny hand wave to pron1 to go back   go back   person1 person1 pron1 cry go back   but the ghost clutch pron1 hand more tightly and pron1 shut pron1 eye against pron1   horrible animal with lizard tail and goggle eye blink at pron1 from the carven chimneypiece and murmur beware   person1 person1 beware   pron1 may never see pron1 again but the ghost glide on more swiftly and person1 do not listen   when pron1 reach the end of the room pron1 stop and mutter some word pron1 could not understand   pron1 open pron1 eye and see the wall slowly fade away like a mist and a great black cavern in front of pron1   a bitter cold wind sweep round pron1 and pron1 feel pron1 pull at pron1 dress   person1 quick cry the ghost or pron1 will be too late and in a moment the wainscoting have close behind pron1 and the tapestry chamber be empty 

  the ghost glide on more swiftly
