let the bird of loud lie 
on the sole arabian tree 
herald sad and trumpet be 
to whose sound chaste wing obey 
but thou shriek person1 
foul precurrer of the fiend 
person1 of the fever be end 
to this troop come thou not near 
from this session interdict 
every fowl of tyrant wing 
save the eagle feather would king 
keep the obsequy so strict 
let the priest in surplice white 
that defunctive music can 
be the death divine swan 
lest the requiem lack pron1 right 
and pron1 treble dated crow 
that pron1 sable person1 person1 person1 
with the breath person1 person1 person1 and person1 person1 
  person1 pron1 mourner shalt person1 go 
here the anthem doth commence 
love and constancy be dead 
person1 and the turtle flee 
in a mutual flame from hence 
so pron1 person1 would as love in twain 
have the essence but in ordinal1 
ordinal1 distinct division none 
number there in love be slay 
heart remote yet not asunder 
distance and no space be see 
  twixt this turtle and pron1 queen 
but in pron1 pron1 be a wonder 
so between pron1 love do shine 
that the turtle see pron1 right 
flame in the phoenix sight 
either be the other be pron1 
property be thus appalled 
that the self be not the same 
single nature be double name 
neither ordinal1 nor ordinal1 be call 
reason in pron1 confound 
saw division grow together 
to pron1 yet either neither 
simple be so well compound 
that pron1 cry how true a twain 
person1 this concordant one 
love hath reason reason none 
if pron1 part can so remain 
whereupon pron1 make this threne 
to the phoenix and the dove 
person1 supreme and star of love 
as chorus to pron1 tragic scene 

person1 
beauty truth and rarity 
grace in all simplicity 
here enclo would in cinder lie 
death be now the phoenix nest 
and the turtle be loyal breast 
to eternity doth rest 
leave no posterity 
  twa not pron1 infirmity 
pron1 be marry chastity 
truth may seem but can not be 
beauty brag but person1 not pron1 
truth and beauty bury be 
to this urn let those repair 
that be either true or fair 
for these dead bird sigh a prayer
