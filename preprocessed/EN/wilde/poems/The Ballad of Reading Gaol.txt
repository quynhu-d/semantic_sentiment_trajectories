  the ballad of read gaol 

by oscar wilde 
version one 



pron1 

pron1 do not wear pron1 scarlet coat 
for blood and wine be red 
and blood and wine be on pron1 hand 
when pron1 find pron1 with the dead 
the poor dead woman pron1 pron1 love 
and murder in pron1 bed 

pron1 walk amongst the trial man 
in a suit of shabby grey 
a cricket cap be on pron1 head 
and pron1 step seem light and gay 
but pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
which prisoner call the sky 
and at every drift cloud pron1 go 
with sail of silver by 

pron1 walk with other soul in pain 
within another ring 
and be wonder if the man have do 
a great or little thing 
when a voice behind pron1 whisper low 
  that fellow be get to swing   

person1 person1   the very prison wall 
suddenly seem to reel 
and the sky above pron1 head become 
like a casque of scorch steel 
and though pron1 be a soul in pain 
pron1 pain pron1 could not feel 

pron1 only know pron1 hunt think 
quickened pron1 step and why 
pron1 look upon the garish day 
with such a wistful eye 
the man have kill the thing pron1 love 
and so pron1 have to die 

yet each man kill the thing pron1 love 
by each let this be hear 
some do pron1 with a bitter look 
some with a flattering word 
the coward do pron1 with a kiss 
the brave man with a sword 

some kill pron1 love when pron1 be young 
and some when pron1 be old 
some strangle with the hand of lust 
some with the hand of gold 
the kind use a knife because 
the dead so soon grow cold 

some love too little some too long 
some sell and other buy 
some do the deed with many tear 
and some without a sigh 
for each man kill the thing pron1 love 
yet each man do not die 

pron1 do not die a death of shame 
on a day of dark disgrace 
nor have a noose about pron1 neck 
nor a cloth upon pron1 face 
nor drop foot foremost through the floor 
into an empty place 

pron1 do not sit with silent man 
pron1 watch pron1 night and day 
pron1 watch pron1 when pron1 try to weep 
and when pron1 try to pray 
pron1 watch pron1 lest pron1 should rob 
the prison of pron1 prey 

pron1 do not wake at dawn to see 
dread figure throng pron1 room 
the shiver chaplain robe in white 
the sheriff stern with gloom 
and the governor all in shiny black 
with the yellow face of doom 

pron1 do not rise in piteous haste 
to put on convict clothe 
while some coarse mouthed doctor gloat and note 
each new and nerve twitch pose 
finger a watch whose little tick 
be like horrible hammer blow 

pron1 do not know that sickening thirst 
that sand ordinal1 be throat before 
the hangman with pron1 gardener be glove 
slip through the padded door 
and bind ordinal1 with ordinal1 leathern thong 
that the throat may thirst no more 

pron1 do not bend pron1 head to hear 
the burial office read 
nor while the terror of pron1 soul 
tell pron1 pron1 be not dead 
cross pron1 own coffin as pron1 move 
into the hideous shed 

pron1 do not stare upon the air 
through a little roof of glass 
pron1 do not pray with lip of clay 
for pron1 agony to pass 
nor feel upon pron1 shudder cheek 
the kiss of person1 



person1 

ordinal1 week pron1 guardsman walk the yard 
in a suit of shabby grey 
pron1 cricket cap be on pron1 head 
and pron1 step seem light and gay 
but pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
which prisoner call the sky 
and at every wander cloud pron1 trail 
pron1 raveled fleece by 

pron1 do not wring pron1 hand as do 
those witless man pron1 dare 
to try to rear the changeling hope 
in the cave of black despair 
pron1 only look upon the sun 
and drank the morning air 

pron1 do not wring pron1 hand nor weep 
nor do pron1 peek or pine 
but pron1 drink the air as though pron1 hold 
some healthful anodyne 
with open mouth pron1 drink the sun 
as though pron1 have be wine 

and pron1 and all the soul in pain 
pron1 tramp the other ring 
forget if pron1 pron1 have do 
a great or little thing 
and watch with gaze of dull amaze 
the man pron1 have to swing 

and strange pron1 be to see pron1 pass 
with a step so light and gay 
and strange pron1 be to see pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 
and strange pron1 be to think that pron1 
have such a debt to pay 

for oak and elm have pleasant leave 
that in the spring time shoot 
but grim to see be the gallow tree 
with pron1 adder bite root 
and green or dry a man must die 
before pron1 bear pron1 fruit 

the lofty place be that seat of grace 
for which all worldling try 
but pron1 would stand in hempen band 
upon a scaffold high 
and through a murderer be collar take 
pron1 last look at the sky 

pron1 be sweet to dance to violin 
when love and life be fair 
to dance to flute to dance to lute 
be delicate and rare 
but pron1 be not sweet with nimble foot 
to dance upon the air 

so with curious eye and sick surmise 
pron1 watch pron1 day by day 
and wonder if each ordinal1 of pron1 
would end the self same way 
for none can tell to pron1 red hell 
pron1 sightless soul may stray 

at last the dead man walk no more 
amongst the trial man 
and pron1 know that pron1 be stand up 
in the black dock be dreadful pen 
and that never would pron1 see pron1 face 
in person1 be sweet world again 

like ordinal1 doom ship pron1 pass in storm 
pron1 have cross each other be way 
but pron1 make no sign pron1 say no word 
pron1 have no word to say 
for pron1 do not meet in the holy night 
but in the shameful day 

a prison wall be round pron1 both 
ordinal1 outcast man be pron1 
the world have thrust pron1 from pron1 heart 
and person1 from out pron1 care 
and the iron gin pron1 wait for sin 
have catch pron1 in pron1 snare 

in debtor yard the stone be hard 
and the dripping wall be high 
so pron1 be there pron1 take the air 
beneath the person1 person1 
and by each side a warder walk 
for fear the man might die 

or else pron1 sit with those pron1 watch 
pron1 anguish night and day 
pron1 watch pron1 when pron1 rise to weep 
and when pron1 crouch to pray 
pron1 watch pron1 lest pron1 should rob 
pron1 scaffold of pron1 prey 

the governor be strong upon 
the regulation act 
the doctor say that death be but 
a scientific fact 
and twice a day the chaplain call 
and leave a little tract 

and twice a day pron1 smoke pron1 pipe 
and drank pron1 quart of beer 
pron1 soul be resolute and hold 
no hiding place for fear 
pron1 often say that pron1 be glad 
the hangman be hand be near 

but why pron1 say so strange a thing 
no warder dare to ask 
for pron1 to pron1 a watcher be doom 
be give as pron1 task 
must set a lock upon pron1 lip 
and make pron1 face a mask 

or else pron1 might be move and try 
to comfort or console 
and pron1 should human pity do 
person1 up in murderer hole 
what word of grace in such a place 
could help a brother be soul 

with slouch and swing around the ring 
pron1 trod the fool be parade 
pron1 do not care pron1 know pron1 be 
the devil be own brigade 
and shaven head and foot of lead 
make a merry masquerade 

pron1 tear the tarry rope to shred 
with blunt and bleeding nail 
pron1 rub the door and scrub the floor 
and clean the shine rail 
and rank by rank pron1 soap the plank 
and clatter with the pail 

pron1 sew the sack pron1 break the stone 
pron1 turn the dusty drill 
pron1 bang the tin and bawl the hymn 
and sweat on the mill 
but in the heart of every man 
person1 be lie still 

so still pron1 lie that every day 
crawl like a weed clog wave 
and pron1 forget the bitter lot 
that wait for fool and knave 
till once as pron1 tramp in from work 
pron1 pass an open grave 

with yawn mouth the yellow hole 
person1 for a live thing 
the very mud cry out for blood 
to the thirsty asphalte ring 
and pron1 know that person1 ordinal1 dawn grow fair 
some prisoner have to swing 

right in pron1 go with soul intent 
on death and dread and doom 
the hangman with pron1 little bag 
go shuffle through the gloom 
and each man tremble as pron1 creep 
into pron1 numbered tomb 

that night the empty corridor 
be full of form of fear 
and up and down the iron town 
stole foot pron1 could not hear 
and through the bar pron1 hide the star 
white face seem to peer 

pron1 lie as ordinal1 pron1 lie and dream 
in a pleasant meadow land 
the watcher watch pron1 as pron1 sleep 
and could not understand 
how pron1 could sleep so sweet a sleep 
with a hangman close at hand 

but pron1 be no sleep when man must weep 
pron1 never yet have weep 
so pron1 the fool the fraud the person1 
that endless vigil keep 
and through each brain on hand of pain 
another be terror creep 

alas   pron1 be a fearful thing 
to feel another be guilt 
for right within the sword of sin 
pierced to pron1 poison hilt 
and as molten lead be the tear pron1 shed 
for the blood pron1 have not spill 

the warder with pron1 shoe of felt 
creep by each padlock door 
and peep and see with eye of awe 
person1 figure on the floor 
and wonder why man knelt to pray 
pron1 never pray before 

all through the night pron1 knelt and pray 
mad mourner of a corpse 
the troubled plume of midnight be 
the plume upon a hearse 
and bitter wine upon a sponge 
be the savior of remorse 

the cock crew the red cock crew 
but never come the day 
and crooked shape of terror crouch 
in the corner where pron1 lay 
and each evil sprite pron1 walk by night 
before pron1 seem to play 

pron1 glide past pron1 glide fast 
like traveler through a mist 
pron1 mock the moon in a rigadoon 
of delicate turn and twist 
and with formal pace and loathsome grace 
the phantom keep pron1 tryst 

with mop and mow pron1 see pron1 go 
slim shadow hand in hand 
about about in ghostly rout 
pron1 trod a saraband 
and the damned grotesque make person1 
like the wind upon the sand 

with the pirouette of marionette 
pron1 trip on point tread 
but with flute of fear pron1 fill the ear 
as pron1 grisly masque pron1 lead 
and loud pron1 sing and loud pron1 sing 
for pron1 sing to wake the dead 

  person1   pron1 cry the world be wide 
but fettered limb go lame 
and once or twice to throw the dice 
be a gentlemanly game 
but pron1 do not win pron1 play with sin 
in the secret house of shame   
no thing of air these antic be 
that frolic with such glee 
to man whose life be hold in gyve 
and whose foot might not go free 
ah   wound of person1   pron1 be live thing 
most terrible to see 
around around pron1 waltz and wound 
some wheel in smirk pair 
with the mincing step of person1 
some sidle up the stair 
and with subtle sneer and fawn leer 
each help pron1 at pron1 prayer 

the morning wind begin to moan 
but still the night go on 
through pron1 giant loom the web of gloom 
creep till each thread be spin 
and as pron1 pray pron1 grow afraid 
of the justice of the sun 

the moan wind go wander round 
the weep prison wall 
till like a wheel of turn steel 
pron1 feel the minute crawl 
o moan wind   pron1 have pron1 do 
to have such a seneschal 

at last pron1 see the shadow bar 
like a lattice work in lead 
move right across the whitewashed wall 
that face pron1 ordinal1 plank bed 
and pron1 know that somewhere in the world 
person1 be dreadful dawn be red 

at ordinal1 o clock pron1 clean pron1 cell 
at ordinal1 all be still 
but the sough and swing of a mighty wing 
the prison seem to fill 
for the person1 of death with icy breath 
have enter in to kill 

pron1 do not pass in purple pomp 
nor ride a moon white person1 
ordinal1 yard of cord and a slide board 
be all the gallow need 
so with rope of shame the herald come 
to do the secret deed 

pron1 be as man pron1 through a person1 
of filthy darkness grope 
pron1 do not dare to breathe a prayer 
or give pron1 anguish scope 
pron1 be dead in each of pron1 
and pron1 be dead be hope 

for man be grim justice go pron1 way 
and will not swerve aside 
pron1 slay the weak pron1 slay the strong 
pron1 have a deadly stride 
with iron heel pron1 slay the strong 
the monstrous parricide 

pron1 wait for the stroke of ordinal1 
each tongue be thick with thirst 
for the stroke of ordinal1 be the stroke of fate 
that make a man accurse 
and fate will use a run noose 
for the good man and the bad 

pron1 have no other thing to do 
save to wait for the sign to come 
so like thing of stone in a valley lone 
quiet pron1 sit and dumb 
but each man be heart beat thick and quick 
like a madman on a drum 

with sudden shock the prison clock 
person1 on the shiver air 
and from all the gaol rise up a wail 
of impotent despair 
like the sound pron1 frighten marsh hear 
from a leper in pron1 lair 

and as pron1 see most fearful thing 
in the crystal of a dream 
pron1 see the greasy person1 rope 
hook to the blacken beam 
and hear the prayer the hangman be snare 
strangle into a scream 

and all the woe pron1 move pron1 so 
that pron1 give that bitter cry 
and the wild regret and the bloody sweat 
none know so well as pron1 
for pron1 pron1 live more life than ordinal1 
more death than pron1 must die 



iv 

pron1 be no chapel on the day 
on which pron1 hang a man 
the chaplain be heart be far too sick 
or pron1 face be far to person1 
or pron1 be that write in pron1 eye 
which none should look upon 

so pron1 keep pron1 close till nigh on noon 
and then pron1 ring the bell 
and the warder with pron1 jingling key 
open each listen cell 
and down the iron stair pron1 tramp 
each from pron1 separate hell 

out into person1 be sweet air pron1 go 
but not in wonted way 
for this man be face be white with fear 
and that man be face be grey 
and pron1 never see sad man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see sad man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
pron1 prisoner call the sky 
and at every careless cloud pron1 pass 
in happy freedom by 

but pron1 be those amongst pron1 all 
pron1 walk with downcast head 
and know that have each get pron1 due 
pron1 should have die instead 
pron1 have but kill a thing pron1 live 
whilst pron1 have kill the dead 

for pron1 pron1 sin a second time 
wake a dead soul to pain 
and draw pron1 from pron1 spot shroud 
and make pron1 bleed again 
and make pron1 bleed great gout of blood 
and make pron1 bleed in vain 

like ape or clown in monstrous garb 
with crooked arrow star 
silently pron1 go round and round 
the slippery asphalte yard 
silently pron1 go round and round 
and no man speak a word 

silently pron1 go round and round 
and through each hollow mind 
the memory of dreadful thing 
rush like a dreadful wind 
an horror stalk before each man 
and terror creep behind 

the warder strut up and down 
and keep pron1 herd of brute 
pron1 uniform be spick and span 
and pron1 wear pron1 person1 suit 
but pron1 know the work pron1 have be at 
by the quicklime on pron1 boot 

for where a grave have open wide 
pron1 be no grave at all 
only a stretch of mud and sand 
by the hideous prison wall 
and a little heap of burn lime 
that the man should have pron1 pall 

for pron1 have a pall this wretched man 
such as few man can claim 
deep down below a prison yard 
naked for great shame 
pron1 lie with fetter on each foot 
person1 in a sheet of flame 

and all the while the burn lime 
eat flesh and bone away 
pron1 eat the brittle bone by night 
and the soft flesh by the day 
pron1 eat the flesh and bone by turn 
but pron1 eat the heart alway 

for ordinal1 long year pron1 will not sow 
or root or seedle there 
for ordinal1 long year the unblessed spot 
will sterile be and bare 
and look upon the wonder sky 
with unreproachful stare 

pron1 think a murderer be heart would taint 
each simple seed pron1 sow 
pron1 be not true   person1 be kindly earth 
be kindly than man know 
and the person1 rise would but blow more red 
the white rise white blow 

out of pron1 mouth a red red rise 
out of pron1 heart a white 
for pron1 can say by pron1 strange way 
person1 bring pron1 will to light 
since the barren staff the person1 bear 
bloom in the great pope be sight 

but neither milk person1 rise nor red 
may bloom in prison air 
the shard the pebble and the flint 
be pron1 pron1 give pron1 there 
for flower have be know to heal 
a common man be despair 

so never will wine red rise or white 
petal by petal fall 
on that stretch of mud and sand pron1 lie 
by the hideous prison wall 
to tell the man pron1 tramp the yard 
that person1 be son die for all 

yet though the hideous prison wall 
still hem pron1 round and round 
and a spirit may not walk by night 
that be with fetter bind 
and a spirit may but weep pron1 lie 
in such unholy ground 

pron1 be at peace this wretched man 
at peace or will be soon 
pron1 be no thing to make pron1 mad 
nor do terror walk at noon 
for the person1 earth in which pron1 lie 
have neither sun nor moon 

pron1 hang pron1 as a beast be hang 
pron1 do not even toll 
a requiem pron1 might have bring 
rest to pron1 startled soul 
but hurriedly pron1 take pron1 out 
and hide pron1 in a hole 

pron1 strip pron1 of pron1 canvas clothe 
and give pron1 to the fly 
pron1 mock the swollen purple throat 
and the stark and stare eye 
and with laughter loud pron1 heap the shroud 
in which pron1 convict lie 

the chaplain would not kneel to pray 
by pron1 dishonor grave 
nor mark pron1 with that bless cross 
that person1 for sinner give 
because the man be ordinal1 of those 
pron1 person1 come down to save 

yet all be well   pron1 have but pass 
to life be appoint bourne 
and alien tear will fill for pron1 
pity be long break urn 
for pron1 mourner will be outcast man 
and outcast always mourn 



v 

pron1 know not whether law be right 
or whether law be wrong 
all pron1 pron1 know pron1 lie in gaol 
be that the wall be strong 
and that each day be like a year 
a year whose day be long 

but this pron1 know that every law 
that man have make for man 
since first man take pron1 brother be life 
and the sad world begin 
but straw the wheat and save the chaff 
with a most evil fan 

this too pron1 know and wise pron1 be 
if each could know the same 
that every prison pron1 man build 
be build with brick of shame 
and bind with bar lest person1 should see 
how man pron1 brother person1 

with bar pron1 blur the gracious moon 
and blind the goodly sun 
and pron1 do well to hide pron1 hell 
for in pron1 thing be do 
that son of person1 nor son of man 
ever should look upon 

the vile deed like poison weed 
bloom well in prison air 
pron1 be only pron1 be good in man 
that waste and wither there 
pale anguish keep the heavy gate 
and the warder be despair 

for pron1 starve the little frightened child 
till pron1 weep both night and day 
and pron1 scourge the weak and flog the fool 
and gibe the old and grey 
and some grow mad and all grow bad 
and none a word may say 

each narrow cell in which pron1 dwell 
be a foul and dark latrine 
and the fetid breath of live death 
choke up each grated screen 
and all but lust be turn to dust 
in humanity be machine 

the brackish water pron1 pron1 drink 
creep with a loathsome slime 
and the bitter bread pron1 weigh in scale 
be full of chalk and lime 
and sleep will not lie down but walk 
wild eyed and cry to time 

but though lean hunger and green thirst 
like asp with adder fight 
pron1 have little care of prison fare 
for pron1 chill and kill outright 
be that every stone ordinal1 lift by day 
become ordinal1 be heart by night 

with midnight always in ordinal1 be heart 
and twilight in ordinal1 be cell 
pron1 turn the crank or tear the rope 
each in pron1 separate hell 
and the silence be more awful far 
than the sound of a brazen bell 

and never a human voice come near 
to speak a gentle word 
and the eye pron1 watch through the door 
be pitiless and hard 
and by all forget pron1 rot and rot 
with soul and body mar 

and thus pron1 rust life be iron chain 
degraded and alone 
and some man curse and some man weep 
and some man make no moan 
but person1 be eternal law be kind 
and break the heart of stone 

and every human heart pron1 break 
in prison cell or yard 
be as that break box pron1 give 
pron1 treasure to the person1 
and fill the unclean leper be house 
with the scent of costly nard 

ah   happy day pron1 whose heart can break 
and peace of pardon win 
how else may man make straight pron1 plan 
and cleanse pron1 soul from sin 
how else but through a broken heart 
person1 person1 person1 enter in 

and pron1 of the swollen purple throat 
and the stark and stare eye 
wait for the holy hand pron1 take 
the thief to person1 
and a broken and a contrite heart 
the person1 will not despise 

the man in red pron1 read the law 
give pron1 ordinal1 week of life 
ordinal1 little week in which to heal 
pron1 soul of pron1 soul be strife 
and cleanse from every blot of blood 
the hand pron1 hold the knife 

and with tear of blood pron1 cleanse the hand 
the hand pron1 hold the steel 
for only blood can wipe out blood 
and only tear can heal 
and the crimson stain pron1 be of person1 
become person1 be snow white seal 



person1 

in read gaol by read town 
pron1 be a pit of shame 
and in pron1 lie a wretched man 
eat by tooth of flame 
in burn wind sheet pron1 lie 
and pron1 grave have get no name 

and there till person1 call forth the dead 
in silence let pron1 lie 
no need to waste the foolish tear 
or heave the windy sigh 
the man have kill the thing pron1 love 
and so pron1 have to die 

and all man kill the thing pron1 love 
by all let this be hear 
some do pron1 with a bitter look 
some with a flattering word 
the coward do pron1 with a kiss 
the brave man with a sword 





version ordinal1 


pron1 

pron1 do not wear pron1 scarlet coat 
for blood and wine be red 
and blood and wine be on pron1 hand 
when pron1 find pron1 with the dead 
the poor dead woman pron1 pron1 love 
and murder in pron1 bed 

pron1 walk amongst the trial man 
in a suit of shabby gray 
a cricket cap be on pron1 head 
and pron1 step seem light and gay 
but pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
which prisoner call the sky 
and at every drift cloud pron1 go 
with sail of silver by 

pron1 walk with other soul in pain 
within another ring 
and be wonder if the man have do 
a great or little thing 
when a voice behind pron1 whisper low 
  that fellow be get to swing   

person1 person1   the very prison wall 
suddenly seem to reel 
and the sky above pron1 head become 
like a casque of scorch steel 
and though pron1 be a soul in pain 
pron1 pain pron1 could not feel 

pron1 only know pron1 haunted thought 
quickened pron1 step and why 
pron1 look upon the garish day 
with such a wistful eye 
the man have kill the thing pron1 love 
and so pron1 have to die 

yet each man kill the thing pron1 love 
by each let this be hear 
some do pron1 with a bitter look 
some with a flattering word 
the coward do pron1 with a kiss 
the brave man with a sword 

some kill pron1 love when pron1 be young 
and some when pron1 be old 
some strangle with the hand of lust 
some with the hand of gold 
the kind use a knife because 
the dead so soon grow cold 

some love too little some too long 
some sell and other buy 
some do the deed with many tear 
and some without a sigh 
for each man kill the thing pron1 love 
yet each man do not die 

pron1 do not die a death of shame 
on a day of dark disgrace 
nor have a noose about pron1 neck 
nor a cloth upon pron1 face 
nor drop foot foremost through the floor 
into an empty space 

pron1 do not sit with silent man 
pron1 watch pron1 night and day 
pron1 watch pron1 when pron1 try to weep 
and when pron1 try to pray 
pron1 watch pron1 lest pron1 should rob 
the prison of pron1 prey 

pron1 do not wake at dawn to see 
dread figure throng pron1 room 
the shiver chaplain robe in white 
the sheriff stern with gloom 
and the governor all in shiny black 
with the yellow face of doom 

pron1 do not rise in piteous haste 
to put on convict clothe 
while some coarse mouthed doctor gloat and note 
each new and nerve twitch pose 
finger a watch whose little tick 
be like horrible hammer blow 

pron1 do not feel that sickening thirst 
that sand ordinal1 be throat before 
the hangman with pron1 gardener be glove 
come through the padded door 
and bind ordinal1 with ordinal1 leathern thong 
that the throat may thirst no more 

pron1 do not bend pron1 head to hear 
the burial office read 
nor while the anguish of pron1 soul 
tell pron1 pron1 be not dead 
cross pron1 own coffin as pron1 move 
into the hideous shed 

pron1 do not stare upon the air 
through a little roof of glass 
pron1 do not pray with lip of clay 
for pron1 agony to pass 
nor feel upon pron1 shudder cheek 
the kiss of person1 



ii 

ordinal1 week the guardsman walk the yard 
in the suit of shabby gray 
pron1 cricket cap be on pron1 head 
and pron1 step be light and gay 
but pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see a man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
which prisoner call the sky 
and at every wander cloud pron1 trail 
pron1 ravelled fleece by 

pron1 do not wring pron1 hand as do 
those witless man pron1 dare 
to try to rear the changeling hope 
in the cave of black despair 
pron1 only look upon the sun 
and drank the morning air 

pron1 do not wring pron1 hand nor weep 
nor do pron1 peek or pine 
but pron1 drink the air as though pron1 hold 
some healthful anodyne 
with open mouth pron1 drink the sun 
as though pron1 have be wine 

and pron1 and all the soul in pain 
pron1 tramp the other ring 
forget if pron1 pron1 have do 
a great or little thing 
and watch with gaze of dull amaze 
the man pron1 have to swing 

for strange pron1 be to see pron1 pass 
with a step so light and gay 
and strange pron1 be to see pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 
and strange pron1 be to think that pron1 
have such a debt to pay 

the oak and elm have pleasant leave 
that in the spring time shoot 
but grim to see be the gallow tree 
with pron1 alder bite root 
and green or dry a man must die 
before pron1 bear pron1 fruit 

the lofty place be the seat of grace 
for which all worldling try 
but pron1 would stand in hempen band 
upon a scaffold high 
and through a murderer be collar take 
pron1 last look at the sky 

pron1 be sweet to dance to violin 
when love and life be fair 
to dance to flute to dance to lute 
be delicate and rare 
but pron1 be not sweet with nimble foot 
to dance upon the air 

so with curious eye and sick surmise 
pron1 watch pron1 day by day 
and wonder if each ordinal1 of pron1 
would end the self same way 
for none can tell to pron1 red hell 
pron1 sightless soul may stray 

at last the dead man walk no more 
amongst the trial man 
and pron1 know that pron1 be stand up 
in the black dock be dreadful pen 
and that never would pron1 see pron1 face 
for weal or woe again 

like ordinal1 doom ship pron1 pass in storm 
pron1 have cross each other be way 
but pron1 make no sign pron1 say no word 
pron1 have no word to say 
for pron1 do not meet in the holy night 
but in the shameful day 

a prison wall be round pron1 both 
ordinal1 outcast man pron1 be 
the world have thrust pron1 from pron1 heart 
and person1 from out pron1 care 
and the iron gin pron1 wait for sin 
have catch pron1 in pron1 snare 
iii 

in debtor yard the stone be hard 
and the dripping wall be high 
so pron1 be there pron1 take the air 
beneath the person1 person1 
and by each side a warder walk 
for fear the man might die 

or else pron1 sit with those pron1 watch 
pron1 anguish night and day 
pron1 watch pron1 when pron1 rise to weep 
and when pron1 crouch to pray 
pron1 watch pron1 lest pron1 should rob 
pron1 scaffold of pron1 prey 

the governor be strong upon 
the regulation act 
the doctor say that death be but 
a scientific fact 
and twice a day the chaplain call 
and leave a little tract 

and twice a day pron1 smoke pron1 pipe 
and drank pron1 quart of beer 
pron1 soul be resolute and hold 
no hiding place for fear 
pron1 often say that pron1 be glad 
the hangman be day be near 

but why pron1 say so strange a thing 
no warder dare to ask 
for pron1 to pron1 a watcher be doom 
be give as pron1 task 
must set a lock upon pron1 lip 
and make pron1 face a mask 

or else pron1 might be move and try 
to comfort or console 
and pron1 should human pity do 
person1 up in murderer hole 
what word of grace in such a place 
could help a brother be soul 

with slouch and swing around the ring 
pron1 trod the fool parade 
pron1 do not care pron1 know pron1 be 
the devil own brigade 
and shaven head and foot of lead 
make a merry masquerade 

pron1 tear the tarry rope to shred 
with blunt and bleeding nail 
pron1 rub the door and scrub the floor 
and clean the shine rail 
and rank by rank pron1 soap the plank 
and clatter with the pail 

pron1 sew the sack pron1 break the stone 
pron1 turn the dusty drill 
pron1 bang the tin and bawl the hymn 
and sweat on the mill 
but in the heart of every man 
person1 be lie still 

so still pron1 lie that every day 
crawl like a weed clog wave 
and pron1 forget the bitter lot 
that wait for fool and knave 
till once as pron1 tramp in from work 
pron1 pass an open grave 

with yawn mouth the horrid hole 
person1 for a live thing 
the very mud cry out for blood 
to the thirsty asphalte ring 
and pron1 know that person1 ordinal1 dawn grow fair 
the fellow have to swing 

right in pron1 go with soul intent 
on death and dread and doom 
the hangman with pron1 little bag 
go shuffle through the gloom 
and pron1 tremble as pron1 grope pron1 way 
into pron1 numbered tomb 

that night the empty corridor 
be full of form of fear 
and up and down the iron town 
stole foot pron1 could not hear 
and through the bar pron1 hide the star 
white face seem to peer 

pron1 lie as ordinal1 pron1 lie and dream 
in a pleasant meadow land 
the watcher watch pron1 as pron1 sleep 
and could not understand 
how pron1 could sleep so sweet a sleep 
with a hangman close at hand 

but pron1 be no sleep when man must weep 
pron1 never yet have weep 
so pron1 the fool the fraud the person1 
that endless vigil keep 
and through each brain on hand of pain 
another be terror creep 

alas   pron1 be a fearful thing 
to feel another be guilt 
for right within the sword of sin 
pierced to pron1 poison hilt 
and as molten lead be the tear pron1 shed 
for the blood pron1 have not spill 

the warder with pron1 shoe of felt 
creep by each padlock door 
and peep and see with eye of awe 
person1 figure on the floor 
and wonder why man knelt to pray 
pron1 never pray before 

all through the night pron1 knelt and pray 
mad mourner of a corse 
the troubled plume of midnight shake 
like the plume upon a hearse 
and as bitter wine upon a sponge 
be the savour of remorse 

the gray cock crew the red cock crew 
but never come the day 
and crooked shape of terror crouch 
in the corner where pron1 lay 
and each evil sprite pron1 walk by night 
before pron1 seem to play 

pron1 glide past the glide fast 
like traveller through a mist 
pron1 mock the moon in a rigadoon 
of delicate turn and twist 
and with formal pace and loathsome grace 
the phantom keep pron1 tryst 

with mop and mow pron1 see pron1 go 
slim shadow hand in hand 
about about in ghostly rout 
pron1 trod a saraband 
and the damned grotesque make person1 
like the wind upon the sand 

with the pirouette of marionette 
pron1 trip on point tread 
but with flute of fear pron1 fill the ear 
as pron1 grisly masque pron1 lead 
and loud pron1 sing and long pron1 sing 
for pron1 sing to wake the dead 

  person1   pron1 cry the world be wide 
but fettered limb go lame 
and once or twice to throw the dice 
be a gentlemanly game 
but pron1 do not win pron1 play with sin 
in the secret house of shame   

no thing of air these antic be 
that frolic with such glee 
to man whose life be hold in gyve 
and whose foot might not go free 
ah   wound of person1   pron1 be live thing 
most terrible to see 

around around pron1 waltz and wound 
some wheel in smirk pair 
with the mincing step of a person1 
some sidle up the stair 
and with subtle sneer and fawn leer 
each help pron1 at pron1 prayer 

the morning wind begin to moan 
but still the night go on 
through pron1 giant loom the web of gloom 
creep till each thread be spin 
and as pron1 pray pron1 grow afraid 
of the justice of the sun 

the moan wind go wander round 
the weep prison wall 
till like a wheel of turn steel 
pron1 feel the minute crawl 
o moan wind   pron1 have pron1 do 
to have such a seneschal 

at last pron1 see the shadow bar 
like a lattice work in lead 
move right across the whitewashed wall 
that face pron1 ordinal1 plank bed 
and pron1 know that somewhere in the world 
person1 be dreadful dawn be red 

at ordinal1 o clock pron1 clean pron1 cell 
at ordinal1 all be still 
but the sough and swing of a mighty wing 
the prison seem to fill 
for the person1 of death with icy breath 
have enter in to kill 

pron1 do not pass in purple pomp 
nor ride a moon white person1 
ordinal1 yard of cord and a slide board 
be all the gallow need 
so with rope of shame the herald come 
to do the secret deed 

pron1 be as man pron1 through a person1 
of filthy darkness grope 
pron1 do not dare to breathe a prayer 
or to give pron1 anguish scope 
pron1 be dead in each of pron1 
and pron1 be dead be hope 

for man be grim justice go pron1 way 
and will not swerve aside 
pron1 slay the weak pron1 slay the strong 
pron1 have a deadly stride 
with iron heel pron1 slay the strong 
the monstrous parricide 

pron1 wait for the stroke of ordinal1 
each tongue be thick with thirst 
for the stroke of ordinal1 be the stroke of fate 
that make a man accurse 
and fate will use a run noose 
for the good man and the bad 

pron1 have no other thing to do 
save to wait for the sign to come 
so like thing of stone in a valley lone 
quiet pron1 sit and dumb 
but each man be heart beat thick and quick 
like a madman on a drum 

with sudden shock the prison clock 
person1 on the shiver air 
and from all the gaol rise up a wail 
of impotent despair 
like the sound the frightened marsh hear 
from some leper in pron1 lair 

and as pron1 see most fearful thing 
in the crystal of a dream 
pron1 see the greasy person1 rope 
hook to the blacken beam 
and hear the prayer the hangman be snare 
strangle into a scream 

and all the woe pron1 move pron1 so 
that pron1 give that bitter cry 
and the wild regret and the bloody sweat 
none know so well as pron1 
for pron1 pron1 live more life than ordinal1 
more death pron1 pron1 must die 
iv 

pron1 be no chapel on the day 
on which pron1 hang a man 
the chaplain be heart be far too sick 
or pron1 face be far too person1 
or pron1 be that write in pron1 eye 
which none should look upon 

so pron1 keep pron1 close till nigh on noon 
and then pron1 ring the bell 
and the warder with pron1 jingling key 
open each listen cell 
and down the iron stair pron1 tramp 
each from pron1 separate hell 

out into person1 be sweet air pron1 go 
but not in wonted way 
for this man be face be white with fear 
and that man be face be gray 
and pron1 never see sad man pron1 look 
so wistfully at the day 

pron1 never see sad man pron1 look 
with such a wistful eye 
upon that little tent of blue 
pron1 prisoner call the sky 
and at every happy cloud pron1 pass 
in such strange freedom by 

but pron1 be those amongst pron1 all 
pron1 walk with downcast head 
and know that have each get pron1 due 
pron1 should have die instead 
pron1 have but kill a thing pron1 live 
whilst pron1 have kill the dead 

for pron1 pron1 sin a second time 
wake a dead soul to pain 
and draw pron1 from pron1 spot shroud 
and make pron1 bleed again 
and make pron1 bleed great gout of blood 
and make pron1 bleed in vain 

like ape or clown in monstrous garb 
with crooked arrow star 
silently pron1 go round and round 
the slippery asphalte yard 
silently pron1 go round and round 
and no man speak a word 

silently pron1 go round and round 
and through each hollow mind 
the memory of dreadful thing 
rush like a dreadful wind 
and horror stalk before each man 
and terror creep behind 

the warder strut up and down 
and watch pron1 herd of brute 
pron1 uniform be spick and span 
and pron1 wear pron1 person1 suit 
but pron1 know the work pron1 have be at 
by the quicklime on pron1 boot 

for where a grave have open wide 
pron1 be no grave at all 
only a stretch of mud and sand 
by the hideous prison wall 
and a little heap of burn lime 
that the man should have pron1 pall 

for pron1 have a pall this wretched man 
such as few man can claim 
deep down below a prison yard 
naked for great shame 
pron1 lie with fetter on each foot 
person1 in a sheet of flame 

and all the while the burn lime 
eat flesh and bone away 
pron1 eat the brittle bone by night 
and the soft flesh by day 
pron1 eat the flesh and bone by turn 
but pron1 eat the heart alway 

for ordinal1 long year pron1 will not sow 
or root or seedle there 
for ordinal1 long year the unblessed spot 
will sterile be and bare 
and look upon the wonder sky 
with unreproachful stare 

pron1 think a murderer be heart would taint 
each simple seed pron1 sow 
pron1 be not true   person1 be kindly earth 
be kindly than man know 
and the person1 rise would but glow more red 
the white rise white blow 

out of pron1 mouth a red red rise 
out of pron1 heart a white 
for pron1 can say by pron1 strange way 
person1 bring pron1 will to light 
since the barren staff the person1 bear 
bloom in the great pope be sight 

but neither milk person1 rise nor red 
may bloom in prison air 
the shard the pebble and the flint 
be pron1 pron1 give pron1 there 
for flower have be know to heal 
a common man be despair 

so never will wine red rise or white 
petal by petal fall 
on that stretch of mud and sand pron1 lie 
by the hideous prison wall 
to tell the man pron1 tramp the yard 
that person1 be son die for all 

yet though the hideous prison wall 
still hem pron1 round and round 
and a spirit may not walk by night 
that be with fetter bind 
and a spirit may but weep pron1 lie 
in such unholy ground 

pron1 be at peace this wretched man 
at peace or will be soon 
pron1 be no thing to make pron1 mad 
nor do terror walk at noon 
for the person1 earth in which pron1 lie 
have neither sun nor moon 

pron1 hang pron1 as a beast be hang 
pron1 do not even toll 
a requiem pron1 might have bring 
rest to pron1 startled soul 
but hurriedly pron1 take pron1 out 
and hide pron1 in a hole 

the warder strip pron1 of pron1 clothe 
and give pron1 to the fly 
pron1 mock the swollen purple throat 
and the stark and stare eye 
and with laughter loud pron1 heap the shroud 
in which the convict lie 

the chaplain would not kneel to pray 
by pron1 dishonour grave 
nor mark pron1 with that bless cross 
that person1 for sinner give 
because the man be ordinal1 of those 
pron1 person1 come down to save 

yet all be well   pron1 have but pass 
to life be appoint bourne 
and alien tear will fill for pron1 
pity be long break urn 
for pron1 mourner be outcast man 
and outcast always mourn 
v 

pron1 know not whether law be right 
or whether law be wrong 
all pron1 pron1 know pron1 lie in gaol 
be that the wall be strong 
and that each day be like a year 
a year whose day be long 

but this pron1 know that every law 
that man have make for man 
since first man take pron1 brother be life 
and the sad world begin 
but straw the wheat and save the chaff 
with a most evil fan 

this too pron1 know and wise pron1 be 
if each could know the same 
that every prison pron1 man build 
be build with brick of shame 
and bind with bar lest person1 should see 
how man pron1 brother person1 

with bar pron1 blur the gracious moon 
and blind the goodly sun 
and pron1 do well to hide pron1 hell 
for in pron1 thing be do 
that son of person1 nor son of man 
ever should look upon 

the vile deed like poison weed 
bloom well in prison air 
pron1 be only pron1 be good in man 
that waste and wither there 
pale anguish keep the heavy gate 
and the warder be despair 

for pron1 starve the little frightened child 
till pron1 weep both night and day 
and pron1 scourge the weak and flog the fool 
and gibe the old and gray 
and some grow mad and all grow bad 
and none a word may say 

each narrow cell in which pron1 dwell 
be a foul and dark latrine 
and the fetid breath of live death 
choke up each grated screen 
and all but lust be turn to dust 
in humanity be machine 

the brackish water pron1 pron1 drink 
creep with a loathsome slime 
and the bitter bread pron1 weigh in scale 
be full of chalk and lime 
and sleep will not lie down but walk 
wild eyed and cry to time 

but though lean hunger and green thirst 
like asp with adder fight 
pron1 have little care of prison fare 
for pron1 chill and kill outright 
be that every stone ordinal1 lift by day 
become ordinal1 be heart by night 

with midnight always in ordinal1 be heart 
and twilight in ordinal1 be cell 
pron1 turn the crank or tear the rope 
each in pron1 separate hell 
and the silence be more awful far 
than the sound of a brazen bell 

and never a human voice come near 
to speak a gentle word 
and the eye pron1 watch through the door 
be pitiless and hard 
and by all forget pron1 rot and rot 
with soul and body mar 

and thus pron1 rust life be iron chain 
degraded and alone 
and some man curse and some man weep 
and some man make no moan 
but person1 be eternal law be kind 
and break the heart of stone 

and every human heart pron1 break 
in prison cell or yard 
be as that break box pron1 give 
pron1 treasure to the person1 
and fill the unclean leper be house 
with the scent of costly nard 

ah   happy pron1 whose heart can break 
and peace of pardon win 
how else may man make straight pron1 plan 
and cleanse pron1 soul from sin 
how else but through a broken heart 
person1 person1 person1 enter in 

and pron1 of the swollen purple throat 
and the stark and stare eye 
wait for the holy hand pron1 take 
the thief to person1 
and a broken and a contrite heart 
the person1 will not despise 

the man in red pron1 read the law 
give pron1 ordinal1 week of life 
ordinal1 little week in which to heal 
pron1 soul of pron1 soul be strife 
and cleanse from every blot of blood 
the hand pron1 hold the knife 

and with tear of blood pron1 cleanse the hand 
the hand pron1 hold the steel 
for only blood can wipe out blood 
and only tear can heal 
and the crimson stain pron1 be of person1 
become person1 be snow white seal 
vi 

in read gaol by read town 
pron1 be a pit of shame 
and in pron1 lie a wretched man 
eat by tooth of flame 
in a burning wind sheet pron1 lie 
and pron1 grave have get no name 

and there till person1 call forth the dead 
in silence let pron1 lie 
no need to waste the foolish tear 
or heave the windy sigh 
the man have kill the thing pron1 love 
and so pron1 have to die 

and all man kill the thing pron1 love 
by all let this be hear 
some do pron1 with a bitter look 
some with a flattering word 
the coward do pron1 with a kiss 
the brave man with a sword 


the end
