the nightingale and the rise 
decorative graphic of young man lie on grass 

  pron1 say that pron1 would dance with pron1 if pron1 bring pron1 red rose cry the young student   but in all pron1 garden pron1 be no red rise   

from pron1 nest in the holm oak tree the nightingale hear pron1 and pron1 look out through the leave and wonder 

  no red rise in all pron1 garden   pron1 cry and pron1 beautiful eye fill with tear   ah on pron1 little thing do happiness depend   pron1 have read all pron1 the wise man have write and all the secret of philosophy be mine yet for want of a person1 rise be pron1 life make wretched   

  here at last be a true lover say the nightingale   person1 after night have pron1 sing of pron1 though pron1 know pron1 not night after night have pron1 tell pron1 story to the star and now pron1 see pron1   pron1 hair be dark as the hyacinth blossom and pron1 lip be red as the rose of pron1 desire   but passion have make pron1 face like pale ivory and sorrow have set pron1 seal upon pron1 brow   

  the prince give a ball to morrow person1 murmur the young student and pron1 love will be of the company   if pron1 bring pron1 a red rise pron1 will dance with pron1 till dawn   if pron1 bring pron1 a red rise pron1 shall hold pron1 in pron1 arm and pron1 will lean pron1 head upon pron1 shoulder and pron1 hand will be clasp in mine   but pron1 be no red rise in pron1 garden so pron1 shall sit lonely and pron1 will pass pron1 by   pron1 will have no heed of pron1 and pron1 heart will break   

  here indeed be the true lover say the nightingale   pron1 pron1 sing of pron1 suffer pron1 be joy to pron1 to pron1 be pain   surely love be a wonderful thing   pron1 be more precious than emerald and dear than fine opal   person1 and pomegranate can not buy pron1 nor be pron1 set forth in the marketplace   pron1 may not be purchase of the merchant nor can pron1 be weigh out in the balance for gold   

  the musician will sit in pron1 gallery say the young student and play upon pron1 stringed instrument and pron1 love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin   pron1 will dance so lightly that pron1 foot will not touch the floor and the courtier in pron1 gay dress will throng round pron1   but with pron1 pron1 will not dance for pron1 have no red rise to give pron1     and pron1 fling pron1 down on the grass and bury pron1 face in pron1 hand and weep 

  why be pron1 weep   ask a little green lizard as pron1 run past pron1 with pron1 tail in the air 

  why indeed   say a butterfly pron1 be flutter about after a sunbeam 

  why indeed   whisper a daisy to pron1 neighbour in a soft low voice 

  pron1 be weep for a person1 rise say the nightingale 

  for a red rise   pron1 cry   how very ridiculous   and the little lizard pron1 be pron1 of a cynic laugh outright 

but the nightingale understand the secret of the student be sorrow and pron1 sit silent in the oak tree and think about the mystery of love 

suddenly pron1 spread pron1 brown wing for flight and soar into the air   pron1 pass through the grove like a shadow and like a shadow pron1 sail across the garden 

in the centre of the grass plot be stand a beautiful rose tree and when pron1 see pron1 pron1 fly over to pron1 and light upon a spray 

  give pron1 a red rise pron1 cry and pron1 will sing pron1 pron1 sweetest song   

but the tree shake pron1 head 

  pron1 rose be white pron1 answer   as white as the foam of the sea and white than the snow upon the mountain   but go to pron1 brother pron1 grow round the old sun dial and perhaps pron1 will give pron1 pron1 pron1 want   

so the nightingale fly over to the rose tree pron1 be grow round the old sun dial 

  give pron1 a red rise pron1 cry and pron1 will sing pron1 pron1 sweetest song   

but the tree shake pron1 head 

  pron1 rose be yellow pron1 answer   as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden pron1 sit upon an amber throne and yellower than the daffodil pron1 bloom in the meadow before the mower come with pron1 scythe   but go to pron1 brother pron1 grow beneath the student be window and perhaps pron1 will give pron1 pron1 pron1 want   

so the nightingale fly over to the rose tree pron1 be grow beneath the student be window 

  give pron1 a red rise pron1 cry and pron1 will sing pron1 pron1 sweetest song   

but the tree shake pron1 head 

  pron1 rose be red pron1 answer as red as the foot of the dove and red than the great fan of coral that wave and wave in the ocean cavern   but the winter have chill pron1 vein and the frost have nip pron1 bud and the storm have break pron1 branch and pron1 shall have no rose at all this year   

  ordinal1 person1 rise be all pron1 want cry the nightingale only ordinal1 red rise   be pron1 no way by which pron1 can get pron1   

  pron1 be a way answer the tree   but pron1 be so terrible that pron1 dare not tell pron1 to pron1   

  tell pron1 to pron1 say the nightingale pron1 be not afraid   

  if pron1 want a person1 rise say the tree pron1 must build pron1 out of music by moonlight and stain pron1 with pron1 own heart be blood   pron1 must sing to pron1 with pron1 breast against a thorn   all night long pron1 must sing to pron1 and the thorn must pierce pron1 heart and pron1 life blood must flow into pron1 vein and become pron1   

  death be a great price to pay for a red rise cry the nightingale and life be very dear to all   pron1 be pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in pron1 chariot of gold and the moon in pron1 chariot of pearl   person1 be the scent of the hawthorn and sweet be the bluebell pron1 hide in the valley and the heather pron1 blow on the hill   yet love be well than life and pron1 be the heart of a bird compare to the heart of a man   

so pron1 spread pron1 brown wing for flight and soar into the air   pron1 sweep over the garden like a shadow and like a shadow pron1 sail through the grove 

the young student be still lie on the grass where pron1 have leave pron1 and the tear be not yet dry in pron1 beautiful eye 

  be happy cry the nightingale be happy   pron1 shall have pron1 red rise   pron1 will build pron1 out of music by moonlight and stain pron1 with pron1 own heart be blood   all pron1 pron1 ask of pron1 in return be that pron1 will be a true lover for love be wise than philosophy though pron1 be wise and mighty than power though pron1 be mighty   flame colour be pron1 wing and colour like flame be pron1 body   pron1 lip be sweet as honey and pron1 breath be like frankincense   

the student look up from the grass and listen but pron1 could not understand pron1 the nightingale be say to pron1 for pron1 only know the thing pron1 be write down in book 

but the oak tree understand and feel sad for pron1 be very fond of the little nightingale pron1 have build pron1 nest in pron1 branch 

  sing pron1 ordinal1 last song pron1 whisper   pron1 shall feel very lonely when pron1 be go   

so the nightingale sing to the oak tree and pron1 voice be like water bubble from a silver jar 

when pron1 have finish pron1 song the student get up and pull a note book and a lead pencil out of pron1 pocket 

  pron1 have form pron1 say to pron1 as pron1 walk away through the grove pron1 can not be deny to pron1   but have pron1 get feel   pron1 be afraid not   in fact pron1 be like most artist   pron1 be all style without any sincerity   pron1 would not sacrifice pron1 for other   pron1 think merely of music and pron1 know that the art be selfish   still pron1 must be admit that pron1 have some beautiful note in pron1 voice   pron1 a pity pron1 be that pron1 do not mean pron1 or do any practical good   and pron1 go into pron1 room and lie down on pron1 little pallet bed and begin to think of pron1 love   and after a time pron1 fall asleep 

and when the moon shine in the heaven the nightingale fly to the rose tree and set pron1 breast against the thorn   all night long pron1 sing with pron1 breast against the thorn and the person1 person1 person1 lean down and listen   all night long pron1 sing and the thorn go deeply and deep into pron1 breast and pron1 life blood ebb away from pron1 

pron1 sing first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl   and on the top most spray of the rose tree there blossom a marvellous rose petal follow petal as song follow song   person1 be pron1 at first as the mist pron1 hang over the river pale as the foot of the morning and silver as the wing of the dawn   as the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver as the shadow of a rose in a water pool so be the rose pron1 blossom on the topmost spray of the tree 

but the tree cry to the nightingale to press close against the thorn   person1 close little nightingale cry the tree or the day will come before the rose be finish   

so the nightingale press close against the thorn and louder and louder grow pron1 song for pron1 sing of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid 

and a delicate flush of pink come into the leave of the rose like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when pron1 kiss the lip of the bride   but the thorn have not yet reach pron1 heart so the rose be heart remain white for only a nightingale be heart be blood can crimson the heart of a rose 

and the tree cry to the nightingale to press close against the thorn   person1 close little nightingale cry the tree or the day will come before the rose be finish   

so the nightingale press close against the thorn and the thorn touch pron1 heart and a fierce pang of pain shoot through pron1   bitter bitter be the pain and wild and wild grow pron1 song for pron1 sing of the love pron1 be perfect by death of the love pron1 die not in the tomb 

and the marvellous rise become crimson like the rose of the eastern sky   person1 be the girdle of petal and crimson as a ruby be the heart 

but the nightingale be voice grow fainter and pron1 little wing begin to beat and a film come over pron1 eye   person1 and fainter grow pron1 song and pron1 feel pron1 choke pron1 in pron1 throat 

then pron1 give ordinal1 last burst of music   the white moon hear pron1 and pron1 forget the dawn and linger on in the sky   the red rise hear pron1 and pron1 tremble all over with ecstasy and open pron1 petal to the cold morning air   person1 bear pron1 to pron1 purple cavern in the hill and wake the sleep shepherd from pron1 dream   pron1 float through the reed of the river and pron1 carry pron1 message to the sea 

  look look   cry the tree the rose be finish now     but the nightingale make no answer for pron1 be lie dead in the long grass with the thorn in pron1 heart 

and at noon the student open pron1 window and look out 

  why pron1 a wonderful piece of luck   pron1 cry   here be a red rise   pron1 have never see any rose like pron1 in all pron1 life   pron1 be so beautiful that pron1 be sure pron1 have a long person1 name     and pron1 lean down and pluck pron1 

then pron1 put on pron1 hat and run up to the professor be house with the rose in pron1 hand 

the daughter of the professor be sit in the doorway wind blue silk on a reel and pron1 little dog be lie at pron1 foot 

  pron1 say that pron1 would dance with pron1 if pron1 bring pron1 a red rise cry the student   here be the red rise in all the world   pron1 will wear pron1 to night next pron1 heart and as pron1 dance together pron1 will tell pron1 how pron1 love pron1   

but the girl frown 

  pron1 be afraid pron1 will not go with pron1 dress pron1 answer   and besides the chamberlain be nephew have send pron1 some real jewel and pron1 know that jewel cost far more than flower   

  well upon pron1 word pron1 be very ungrateful say the student angrily   and pron1 throw the rise into the street where pron1 fall into the gutter and a cart wheel go over pron1 

  ungrateful   say the girl   pron1 tell pron1 pron1 pron1 be very rude   and after all pron1 be pron1   only a student   why pron1 do not believe pron1 have even get silver buckle to pron1 shoe as the chamberlain be nephew have     and pron1 get up from pron1 chair and go into the house 

  pron1 a silly thing love be say the student as pron1 walk away   pron1 be not half as useful as logic for pron1 do not prove pron1 and pron1 be always tell ordinal1 of thing pron1 be not go to happen and make ordinal1 believe thing pron1 be not true   in fact pron1 be quite unpractical and as in this age to be practical be pron1 pron1 shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics   

so pron1 return to pron1 room and pull out a great dusty book and begin to read

pron1 be a very selfish giant 

the poor child have now nowhere to play   pron1 try to play on the road but the road be very dusty and full of hard stone and pron1 do not like pron1   pron1 use to wander round the high wall when pron1 lesson be over and talk about the beautiful garden inside   how happy pron1 be there pron1 say to each other 

then the spring come and all over the country pron1 be little blossom and little bird   only in the garden of the selfish giant pron1 be still winter   the bird do not care to sing in pron1 as pron1 be no child and the tree forget to blossom   once a beautiful flower put pron1 head out from the grass but when pron1 see the notice board pron1 be so sorry for the child pron1 pron1 slip back into the ground again and go off to sleep   the only people pron1 be pleased be the snow and the frost   person1 have forget this garden pron1 cry so pron1 will live here all the year round   the snow cover up the grass with pron1 great white cloak and the frost paint all the tree silver   then pron1 invite the north wind to stay with pron1 and pron1 come   pron1 be wrap in fur and pron1 roar all day about the garden and blow the chimney pot down   this be a delightful spot pron1 say pron1 must ask the hail on a visit   so the hail come   every day for ordinal1 hour pron1 rattle on the roof of the castle till pron1 break most of the slate and then pron1 run round and round the garden as fast as pron1 could go   pron1 be dress in grey and pron1 breath be like ice 

  pron1 can not understand why the spring be so late in come say the selfish giant as pron1 sit at the window and look out at pron1 cold white garden   pron1 hope pron1 will be a change in the weather   

but the spring never come nor the summer   the autumn give golden fruit to every garden but to the giant be garden pron1 give none   pron1 be too selfish pron1 say   so pron1 be always winter there and the north wind and the hail and the frost and the snow dance about through the tree 

ordinal1 morning the giant be lie awake in bed when pron1 hear some lovely music   pron1 sound so sweet to pron1 ear that pron1 think pron1 must be the king be musician pass by   pron1 be really only a little linnet singe outside pron1 window but pron1 be so long since pron1 have hear a bird sing in pron1 garden that pron1 seem to pron1 to be the most beautiful music in the world   then the hail stop dance over pron1 head and the north wind cease roaring and a delicious perfume come to pron1 through the open casement   pron1 believe the spring have come at last say the giant   and pron1 jump out of bed and look out 

pron1 do pron1 see 

pron1 see a most wonderful sight   through a little hole in the wall the child have creep in and pron1 be sit in the branch of the tree   in every tree pron1 pron1 could see pron1 be a little child   and the tree be so glad to have the child back again that pron1 have cover pron1 with blossom and be wave pron1 arm gently above the child be head   the bird be fly about and twitter with delight and the flower be look up through the green grass and laugh   pron1 be a lovely scene only in ordinal1 corner pron1 be still winter   pron1 be the farth corner of the garden and in pron1 be stand a little boy   pron1 be so small that pron1 could not reach up to the branch of the tree and pron1 be wander all round pron1 cry bitterly   the poor tree be still quite covered with frost and snow and the north wind be blow and roar above pron1   climb up   little boy say the tree and pron1 bend pron1 branch down as low as pron1 could   but the boy be too tiny 

and the giant be heart melt as pron1 look out   how selfish pron1 have be   pron1 say   now pron1 know why the spring would not come here   pron1 will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree and then pron1 will knock down the wall and pron1 garden shall be the child be playground for ever and ever   pron1 be really very sorry for pron1 pron1 have do 

so pron1 creep downstairs and open the front door quite softly and go out into the garden   but when the child see pron1 pron1 be so frightened that pron1 all run away and the garden become winter again   only the little boy do not run for pron1 eye be so full of tear pron1 pron1 do not see the giant come   and the giant steal up behind pron1 and take pron1 gently in pron1 hand and put pron1 up into the tree   and the tree break at once into blossom and the bird come and sing on pron1 and the little boy stretch out pron1 ordinal1 arm and fling pron1 round the giant be neck and kiss pron1   and the other child when pron1 see that the giant be not wicked any long come run back and with pron1 come the spring   pron1 be pron1 garden now little child say the giant and pron1 take a great axe and knock down the wall   and when the people be go to market at ordinal1 o clock pron1 find the giant play with the child in the most beautiful garden pron1 have ever see 

all day long pron1 play and in the evening pron1 come to the giant to bid pron1 good bye 

  but where be pron1 little companion   pron1 say the boy pron1 put into the tree   the giant love pron1 the good because pron1 have kiss pron1 

  pron1 do not know answer the child   pron1 have go away   

  pron1 must tell pron1 to be sure and come here to morrow say the giant   but the child say that pron1 do not know where pron1 live and have never see pron1 before   and the giant feel very sad 

every afternoon when school be over the child come and play with the giant   but the little boy pron1 the giant love be never see again   the giant be very kind to all the child yet pron1 long for pron1 first little friend and often speak of pron1   how pron1 would like to see pron1   pron1 use to say 

year go over and the giant grow very old and feeble   pron1 could not play about any more so pron1 sit in a huge armchair and watch the child at pron1 game and admire pron1 garden   pron1 have many beautiful flower pron1 say   but the child be the most beautiful flower of all   

ordinal1 winter morning pron1 look out of pron1 window as pron1 be dress   pron1 do not hate the winter now for pron1 know that pron1 be merely the spring asleep and that the flower be rest 

suddenly pron1 rub pron1 eye in wonder and look and look   pron1 certainly be a marvellous sight   in the farth corner of the garden be a tree quite cover with lovely white blossom   pron1 branch be all golden and silver fruit hang down from pron1 and underneath pron1 stand the little boy pron1 have love 

person1 run the giant in great joy and out into the garden   pron1 hasten across the grass and come near to the child   and when pron1 come quite close pron1 face grow red with anger and pron1 say pron1 hath dare to wound pron1   for on the palm of the child be hand be the print of ordinal1 nail and the print of ordinal1 nail be on the little foot 

  pron1 hath dare to wound pron1   cry the giant   tell pron1 that pron1 may take pron1 big sword and slay pron1   

  nay   answer the child   but these be the wound of love   

  pron1 art thou   say the giant and a strange awe fall on pron1 and pron1 kneel before the little child 

and the child smile on the giant and say to pron1 pron1 let pron1 play once in pron1 garden to day pron1 shall come with pron1 to pron1 garden which be person1   

and when the child run in that afternoon pron1 find the giant lie dead under the tree all cover with white blossom

the devoted friend 
person1 and the miller 

ordinal1 morning the old water rat put pron1 head out of pron1 hole   pron1 have bright beady eye and stiff grey whisker and pron1 tail be like a long bit of black person1 rubber   the little duck be swim about in the pond look just like a lot of yellow canary and pron1 mother pron1 be pure white with real red leg be try to teach pron1 how to stand on pron1 head in the water 

  pron1 will never be in the good society unless pron1 can stand on pron1 head pron1 keep say to pron1   and every now and then pron1 show pron1 how pron1 be do   but the little duck pay no attention to pron1   pron1 be so young that pron1 do not know pron1 an advantage pron1 be to be in society at all 

  pron1 disobedient child   cry the old water rat   pron1 really deserve to be drown   

  pron1 of the kind answer the duck every one must make a beginning and parent can not be too patient   

  ah   pron1 know pron1 about the feeling of parent say the water rat   pron1 be not a family man   in fact pron1 have never be marry and pron1 never intend to be   person1 be all very well in pron1 way but friendship be much high   indeed pron1 know of pron1 in the world pron1 be either nobler or rare than a devoted friendship   

  and pron1 pray be pron1 idea of the duty of a devoted friend   ask a green linnet pron1 be sit in a willow tree hard by and have overhear the conversation 

  yes that be just pron1 pron1 want to know say the duck   and pron1 swim away to the end of the pond and stand upon pron1 head in order to give pron1 child a good example 

  pron1 a silly question   cry the water rat   pron1 should expect pron1 devoted friend to be devoted to pron1 of course   

  and pron1 would pron1 do in return   say the little bird swinge upon a silver spray and flap pron1 tiny wing 

  pron1 do not understand pron1 answer the water rat 

  let pron1 tell pron1 a story on the subject say the linnet 

  be the story about pron1   ask the water rat   if so pron1 will listen to pron1 for pron1 be extremely fond of fiction   

  pron1 be applicable to pron1 answer the linnet   and pron1 fly down and alight upon the bank pron1 tell the story of the devoted friend 

  once upon a time say the linnet pron1 be an honest little fellow name person1   

  be pron1 very distinguished   ask the water rat 

  no answer the linnet pron1 do not think pron1 be distinguish at all except for pron1 kind heart and pron1 funny round good humoured face   pron1 live in a tiny cottage all by pron1 and every day pron1 work in pron1 garden   in all the country side pron1 be no garden so lovely as pron1   person1 person1 grow there and gilly flower and shepherd purse and fair maid of person1   pron1 be damask rose and yellow rose person1 crocus and gold purple violet and white   person1 and person1 person1 and wild basil the cowslip and the flower person1 person1 the daffodil and the clove pink bloom or blossom in pron1 proper order as the month go by ordinal1 flower take another flower be place so that pron1 be always beautiful thing to look at and pleasant odour to smell 

  little han have a great many friend but the most devoted friend of all be big person1 the person1   indeed so devoted be the rich miller to little han that pron1 would never go by pron1 garden without lean over the wall and pluck a large nosegay or a handful of sweet herb or fill pron1 pocket with plum and cherry if pron1 be the fruit season 

  real friend should have pron1 in common the person1 use to say and little han nod and smile and feel very proud of have a friend with such noble idea 

  sometimes indeed the neighbour think pron1 strange that the rich person1 never give little han pron1 in return though pron1 have a ordinal1 sack of flour store away in pron1 mill and ordinal1 milch cow and a large flock of woolly sheep   but han never trouble pron1 head about these thing and pron1 give pron1 great pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful thing the person1 use to say about the unselfishness of true friendship 

  so little han work away in pron1 garden   during the spring the summer and the autumn pron1 be very happy but when the winter come and pron1 have no fruit or flower to bring to the market pron1 suffer a good deal from cold and hunger and often have to go to bed without any supper but a few dry pear or some hard nut   in the winter also pron1 be extremely lonely as the person1 never come to see pron1 then 

  pron1 be no good in pron1 go to see little han as long as the snow last the person1 use to say to pron1 wife for when people be in trouble pron1 should be leave alone and not be bother by visitor   that at least be pron1 idea about friendship and pron1 be sure pron1 be right   so pron1 shall wait till the spring come and then pron1 shall pay pron1 a visit and pron1 will be able to give pron1 a large basket of primrose and pron1 will make pron1 so happy   

  pron1 be certainly very thoughtful about other answer the wife as pron1 sit in pron1 comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire   person1 thoughtful indeed   pron1 be quite a treat to hear pron1 talk about friendship   pron1 be sure the clergyman pron1 could not say such beautiful thing as pron1 do though pron1 do live in a ordinal1 storied house and wear a gold ring on pron1 little finger   

  but could pron1 not ask little han up here   say the person1 be young son   if poor han be in trouble pron1 will give pron1 half pron1 porridge and show pron1 pron1 white rabbit   

  pron1 a silly boy pron1 be   cry the miller   pron1 really do not know pron1 be the use of send pron1 to school   pron1 seem not to learn pron1   why if little han come up here and see pron1 warm fire and pron1 good supper and pron1 great cask of red wine pron1 might get envious and envy be a most terrible thing and would spoil pron1 be nature   pron1 certainly will not allow person1 nature to be spoil   pron1 be pron1 good friend and pron1 will always watch over pron1 and see that pron1 be not lead into any temptation   besides if han come here pron1 might ask pron1 to let pron1 have some flour on credit and that pron1 could not do   person1 be ordinal1 thing and friendship be another and pron1 should not be confuse   why the word be spell differently and mean quite different thing   pron1 can see that   

  how well pron1 talk   say the person1 be wife pour pron1 out a large glass of warm ale   person1 pron1 feel quite drowsy   pron1 be just like be in church   

  lot of people act well answer the miller   but very few people talk well which show that talking be much the more difficult thing of the ordinal1 and much the fine thing also     and pron1 look sternly across the table at pron1 little son pron1 feel so ashamed of pron1 pron1 pron1 hang pron1 head down and grow quite scarlet and begin to cry into pron1 tea   however pron1 be so young that pron1 must excuse pron1   

  be that the end of the story   ask the water rat 

  certainly not answer the linnet pron1 be the beginning   

  then pron1 be quite behind the age say the water rat   every good story teller nowadays start with the end and then go on to the beginning and conclude with the middle   that be the new method   pron1 hear all about pron1 the other day from a critic pron1 be walk round the pond with a young man   pron1 speak of the matter at great length and pron1 be sure pron1 must have be right for pron1 have blue spectacle and a bald head and whenever the young man make any remark pron1 always answer person1   but pray go on with pron1 story   pron1 like the person1 immensely   pron1 have all kind of beautiful sentiment pron1 so pron1 be a great sympathy between pron1   

  well say the linnet hop now on ordinal1 leg and now on the other as soon as the winter be over and the primrose begin to open pron1 pale yellow star the person1 say to pron1 wife that pron1 would go down and see little han 

  why pron1 a good heart pron1 have   cry pron1 wife   pron1 be always think of other   and mind pron1 take the big basket with pron1 for the flower   

  so the person1 tie the sail of the windmill together with a strong iron chain and go down the hill with the basket on pron1 arm 

  good morning little han say the person1 

  good morning say han lean on pron1 spade and smile from ear to ear 

  and how have pron1 be all the winter   say the person1 

  well really cry han pron1 be very good of pron1 to ask very good indeed   pron1 be afraid pron1 have rather a hard time of pron1 but now the spring have come and pron1 be quite happy and all pron1 flower be do well   

  pron1 often talk of pron1 during the winter person1 say the person1 and wonder how pron1 be get on   

  pron1 be kind of pron1 say han   pron1 be half afraid pron1 have forget pron1   

  person1 pron1 be surprised at pron1 say the person1   friendship never forget   that be the wonderful thing about pron1 but pron1 be afraid pron1 do not understand the poetry of life   how lovely pron1 primrose be look by the bye   

  pron1 be certainly very lovely say han and pron1 be a most lucky thing for pron1 that pron1 have so many   pron1 be go to bring pron1 into the market and sell pron1 to the burgomaster be daughter and buy back pron1 wheelbarrow with the money   

  buy back pron1 wheelbarrow   pron1 do not mean to say pron1 have sell pron1   pron1 a very stupid thing to do   

  well the fact be say han nothat pron1 be oblige to   pron1 see the winter be a very bad time for pron1 and pron1 really have no money at all to buy bread with   so pron1 first sell the silver button off pron1 person1 coat and then pron1 sell pron1 silver chain and then pron1 sell pron1 big pipe and at last pron1 sell pron1 wheelbarrow   but pron1 be go to buy pron1 all back again now   

  person1 say the person1 pron1 will give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow   pron1 be not in very good repair   indeed ordinal1 side be go and pron1 be pron1 wrong with the wheel spoke   but in spite of that pron1 will give pron1 to pron1   pron1 know pron1 be very generous of pron1 and a great many people would think pron1 extremely foolish for part with pron1 but pron1 be not like the rest of the world   pron1 think that generosity be the essence of friendship and besides pron1 have get a new wheelbarrow for pron1   yes pron1 may set pron1 mind at ease pron1 will give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow   

  well really that be generous of pron1 say little han and pron1 funny round face glow all over with pleasure   pron1 can easily put pron1 in repair as pron1 have a plank of wood in the house   

  a plank of wood   say the person1   why that be just pron1 pron1 want for the roof of pron1 barn   pron1 be a very large hole in pron1 and the corn will all get damp if pron1 do not stop pron1 up   how lucky pron1 mention pron1   pron1 be quite remarkable how ordinal1 good action always breed another   pron1 have give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow and now pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 plank   of course the wheelbarrow be worth far more than the plank but true friendship never notice thing like that   pray get pron1 at once and pron1 will set to work at pron1 barn this very day   

  certainly cry little han and pron1 run into the shed and drag the plank out 

  pron1 be not a very big plank say the person1 look at pron1 and pron1 be afraid that after pron1 have mend pron1 barn roof pron1 will not be any left for pron1 to mend the wheelbarrow with   but of course that be not pron1 fault   and now as pron1 have give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow pron1 be sure pron1 would like to give pron1 some flower in return   here be the basket and mind pron1 fill pron1 quite full   

  quite full   say little han rather sorrowfully for pron1 be really a very big basket and pron1 know that if pron1 fill pron1 pron1 would have no flower leave for the market and pron1 be very anxious to get pron1 silver button back 

  well really answer the person1 as pron1 have give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow pron1 do not think that pron1 be much to ask pron1 for a few flower   pron1 may be wrong but pron1 should have think that friendship true friendship be quite free from selfishness of any kind   

  pron1 dear friend pron1 good friend cry little han pron1 be welcome to all the flower in pron1 garden   pron1 would much soon have pron1 good opinion than pron1 silver button any day     and pron1 run and pluck all pron1 pretty primrose and fill the person1 be basket 

  good bye person1 person1 say the person1 as pron1 go up the hill with the plank on pron1 shoulder and the big basket in pron1 hand 

  good bye say little han and pron1 begin to dig away quite merrily pron1 be so pleased about the wheelbarrow 

  the next day pron1 be nail up some honeysuckle against the porch when pron1 hear the person1 be voice call to pron1 from the road   so pron1 jump off the ladder and run down the garden and look over the wall 

  pron1 be the miller with a large sack of flour on pron1 back 

  dear little person1 say the person1 would pron1 mind carry this sack of flour for pron1 to market   

  oh pron1 be so sorry say han but pron1 be really very busy to day   pron1 have get all pron1 creeper to nail up and all pron1 flower to water and all pron1 grass to roll   

  well really say the person1 pron1 think that consider that pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow pron1 be rather unfriendly of pron1 to refuse   

  oh do not say that cry little han pron1 would not be unfriendly for the whole world     and pron1 run in for pron1 cap and trudge off with the big sack on pron1 shoulder 

  pron1 be a very hot day and the road be terribly dusty and before han have reach the sixth milestone pron1 be so tired that pron1 have to sit down and rest   however pron1 go on bravely and as last pron1 reach the market   after pron1 have wait there some time pron1 sell the sack of flour for a very good price and then pron1 return home at once for pron1 be afraid that if pron1 stop too late pron1 might meet some robber on the way 

  pron1 have certainly be a hard day say little han to pron1 as pron1 be go to bed but pron1 be glad pron1 do not refuse the person1 for pron1 be pron1 good friend and besides pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow   

  early the next morning the person1 come down to get the money for pron1 sack of flour but little han be so tired that pron1 be still in bed 

  upon pron1 word say the person1 pron1 be very lazy   really consider that pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow pron1 think pron1 might work hard   idleness be a great sin and pron1 certainly do not like any of pron1 friend to be idle or sluggish   pron1 must not mind pron1 speak quite plainly to pron1   of course pron1 should not dream of do so if pron1 be not pron1 friend   but pron1 be the good of friendship if pron1 can not say exactly pron1 pron1 mean   pron1 can say charming thing and try to please and to flatter but a true friend always say unpleasant thing and do not mind give pain   indeed if pron1 be a really true friend pron1 prefer pron1 for pron1 know that then pron1 be do good   

  pron1 be very sorry say little han rub pron1 eye and pull off pron1 night cap but pron1 be so tired that pron1 think pron1 would lie in bed for a little time and listen to the bird singe   do pron1 know that pron1 always work well after hear the bird sing   

  well pron1 be glad of that say the person1 clap little han on the back for pron1 want pron1 to come up to the mill as soon as pron1 be dress and mend pron1 barn roof for pron1   

  poor little han be very anxious to go and work in pron1 garden for pron1 flower have not be water for ordinal1 day but pron1 do not like to refuse the person1 as pron1 be such a good friend to pron1 

  do pron1 think pron1 would be unfriendly of pron1 if pron1 say pron1 be busy   pron1 inquire in a shy and timid voice 

  well really answer the person1 pron1 do not think pron1 be much to ask of pron1 consider that pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow   but of course if pron1 refuse pron1 will go and do pron1 pron1   

  oh   on no account cry little han and pron1 jump out of bed and dress pron1 and go up to the barn 

  pron1 work there all day long till sunset and at sunset the person1 come to see how pron1 be get on 

  have pron1 mend the hole in the roof yet little han   cry the miller in a cheery voice 

  pron1 be quite mend answer little han come down the ladder 

  ah   say the person1 person1 be no work so delightful as the work one do for other   

  pron1 be certainly a great privilege to hear pron1 talk answer little han sit down and wipe pron1 forehead a very great privilege   but pron1 be afraid pron1 shall never have such beautiful idea as pron1 have   

  oh   pron1 will come to pron1 say the person1 but pron1 must take more pain   at present pron1 have only the practice of friendship   some day pron1 will have the theory also   

  do pron1 really think pron1 shall   ask little han 

  pron1 have no doubt of pron1 answer the miller but now that pron1 have mend the roof pron1 have well go home and rest for pron1 want pron1 to drive pron1 sheep to the mountain to morrow   

  poor little han be afraid to say pron1 to this and early the next morning the person1 bring pron1 sheep round to the cottage and han start off with pron1 to the mountain   pron1 take pron1 the whole day to get there and back   and when pron1 return pron1 be so tired that pron1 go off to sleep in pron1 chair and do not wake up till pron1 be broad daylight 

  pron1 a delightful time pron1 shall have in pron1 garden pron1 say and pron1 go to work at once 

  but somehow pron1 be never able to look after pron1 flower at all for pron1 friend the person1 be always come round and send pron1 off on long errand or get pron1 to help at the mill   little han be very much distressed at time as pron1 be afraid pron1 flower would think pron1 have forget pron1 but pron1 console pron1 by the reflection pron1 the person1 be pron1 good friend   besides pron1 use to say pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow and that be an act of pure generosity   

  so little han work away for the person1 and the person1 say all kind of beautiful thing about friendship which han take down in a note book and use to read over at night for pron1 be a very good scholar 

  now pron1 happen that ordinal1 evening little han be sit by pron1 fireside when a loud rap come at the door   pron1 be a very wild night and the wind be blow and roar round the house so terribly that at first pron1 think pron1 be merely the storm   but a second rap come and then a third loud than any of the other 

  pron1 be some poor traveller say little han to pron1 and pron1 run to the door 

  pron1 stand the person1 with a lantern in ordinal1 hand and a big stick in the other 

  dear little han cry the person1 pron1 be in great trouble   pron1 little boy have fall off a ladder and hurt pron1 and pron1 be go for the doctor   but pron1 live so far away and pron1 be such a bad night that pron1 have just occur to pron1 that pron1 would be much well if pron1 go instead of pron1   pron1 know pron1 be go to give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow and so pron1 be only fair that pron1 should do pron1 for pron1 in return   

  certainly cry little han pron1 take pron1 quite as a compliment pron1 come to pron1 and pron1 will start off at once   but pron1 must lend pron1 pron1 lantern as the night be so dark that pron1 be afraid pron1 might fall into the ditch   

  pron1 be very sorry answer the person1 but pron1 be pron1 new lantern and pron1 would be a great loss to pron1 if pron1 happen to pron1   

  well never mind pron1 will do without pron1 cry little han and pron1 take down pron1 great fur coat and pron1 warm scarlet cap and tie a muffler round pron1 throat and start off 

  pron1 a dreadful storm pron1 be   the night be so black that little han could hardly see and the wind be so strong that pron1 could scarcely stand   however pron1 be very courageous and after pron1 have be walk about ordinal1 hour pron1 arrive at the doctor be house and knock at the door 

  pron1 be there   cry the doctor put pron1 head out of pron1 bedroom window 

  little person1 doctor   

  pron1 do pron1 want little han   

  the person1 be son have fall from a ladder and have hurt pron1 and the person1 want pron1 to come at once   

  all right   say the doctor   and pron1 order pron1 horse and pron1 big boot and pron1 lantern and come downstairs and ride off in the direction of the person1 be house little han trudge behind pron1 

  but the storm grow bad and bad and the rain fall in torrent and little han could not see where pron1 be go or keep up with the horse   at last pron1 lose pron1 way and wander off on the moor which be a very dangerous place as pron1 be full of deep hole and pron1 poor little han be drown   pron1 body be find the next day by some goatherd float in a great pool of water and be bring back by pron1 to the cottage 

  pron1 go to little person1 funeral as pron1 be so popular and the person1 be the chief mourner 

  as pron1 be pron1 good friend say the person1 pron1 be only fair that pron1 should have the good place     so pron1 walk at the head of the procession in a long black cloak and every now and then pron1 wipe pron1 eye with a big pocket handkerchief 

  little han be certainly a great loss to every one say the person1 when the funeral be over and pron1 be all seat comfortably in the inn drink spiced wine and eat sweet cake 

  a great loss to pron1 at any rate answer the person1   why pron1 have as good as give pron1 pron1 wheelbarrow and now pron1 really do not know pron1 to do with pron1   pron1 be very much in pron1 way at home and pron1 be in such bad repair pron1 pron1 could not get pron1 for pron1 if pron1 sell pron1   pron1 will certainly take care not to give away pron1 again   ordinal1 always suffer for be generous   

  well   say the water rat after a long pause 

  well that be the end say the linnet 

  but pron1 become of the person1   ask the water rat 

  oh   pron1 really do not know reply the linnet   and pron1 be sure that pron1 do not care   

  pron1 be quite evident then that pron1 have no sympathy in pron1 nature say the water rat 

  pron1 be afraid pron1 do not quite see the moral of the story remark the linnet 

  the pron1   scream the water rat 

  the moral   

  do pron1 mean to say that the story have a moral   

  certainly say the linnet 

  well really say the water rat in a very angry manner pron1 think pron1 should have tell pron1 that before pron1 begin   if pron1 have do so pron1 certainly would not have listen to pron1   in fact pron1 should have say person1 like the critic   however pron1 can say pron1 now     so pron1 shout out pooh at the top of pron1 voice give a whisk with pron1 tail and go back into pron1 hole 

  and how do pron1 like the water rat   ask the duck pron1 come paddle up some minute afterwards   pron1 have a great many good point but for pron1 own part pron1 have a mother be feeling and pron1 can never look at a confirm bachelor without the tear come into pron1 eye   

  pron1 be rather afraid that pron1 have annoy pron1 answer the linnet   the fact be that pron1 tell pron1 a story with a moral   

  ah   that be always a very dangerous thing to do say the duck 

and pron1 quite agree with pron1

decorative graphic of young man kiss the princess 
hand 

at the gate of the castle the prince be wait to receive pron1   pron1 have dreamy violet eye and pron1 hair be like fine gold   when pron1 see pron1 pron1 sink upon ordinal1 knee and kiss pron1 hand 

  pron1 picture be beautiful pron1 murmur but pron1 be more beautiful than pron1 picture     and the little princess blush 

  pron1 be like a white rise before say a young page to pron1 neighbour but pron1 be like a red rise now     and the whole court be delighted 

for the next ordinal1 day pron1 go about say person1 person1 person1 rise person1 rise person1 rise     and the king give order that the page be salary be to be double   as pron1 receive no salary at all this be not of much use to pron1 but pron1 be consider a great honour and be duly publish in the court gazette 

when the ordinal1 day be over the marriage be celebrate   pron1 be a magnificent ceremony and the bride and bridegroom walk hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroider with little pearl   then pron1 be a state banquet which last for ordinal1 hour   the prince and princess sit at the top of the great hall and drink out of a cup of clear crystal   only true lover could drink out of this cup for if false lip touch pron1 pron1 grow grey and dull and cloudy 

  pron1 be quite clear that pron1 love each other say the little page as clear as crystal   and the king double pron1 salary a second time   pron1 an honour   cry all the courtier 

after the banquet pron1 be to be a ball   the bride and bridegroom be to dance the rose dance together and the king have promise to play the flute   pron1 play very badly but no one have ever dare to tell pron1 so because pron1 be the king   indeed pron1 know only ordinal1 air and be never quite certain which one pron1 be play   but pron1 make no matter for pron1 pron1 do pron1 cry out charming   person1   

the last item on the programme be a grand display of firework to be let off exactly at midnight   the little princess have never see a firework in pron1 life so the king have give order that the person1 person1 should be in attendance on the day of pron1 marriage 

  pron1 be firework like   pron1 have ask the prince ordinal1 morning as pron1 be walk on the terrace 

  pron1 be like the person1 person1 say the king pron1 always answer question pron1 be address to other people only much more natural   pron1 prefer pron1 to stars pron1 as pron1 always know when pron1 be go to appear and pron1 be as delightful as pron1 own flute playing   pron1 must certainly see pron1   

so at the end of the king be garden a great stand have be set up and as soon as the person1 person1 have put pron1 in pron1 proper place the firework begin to talk to each other 

  the world be certainly very beautiful cry a little squib   just look at those yellow tulip   why   if pron1 be real cracker pron1 could not be lovely   pron1 be very glad pron1 have travel   travel improve the mind wonderfully and do away with all ordinal1 be prejudice   

  the king be garden be not the world pron1 foolish squib say a big roman candle   the world be an enormous place and pron1 would take pron1 ordinal1 day to see pron1 thoroughly   

  any place pron1 love be the world to pron1 exclaim a pensive catherine wheel pron1 have be attach to an old deal box in early life and pride pron1 on pron1 broken heart   but love be not fashionable any more the poet have kill pron1   pron1 write so much about pron1 pron1 pron1 believe pron1 and pron1 be not surprised   true love suffer and be silent   pron1 remember pron1 once but pron1 be no matter now   romance be a thing of the past   

  nonsense   say the roman candle romance never die   pron1 be like the moon and live for ever   the bride and bridegroom for instance love each other very dearly   pron1 hear all about pron1 this morning from a brown paper cartridge pron1 happen to be stay in the same drawer as pron1 and know the late court news   

but the person1 person1 shake pron1 head   romance be dead romance be dead romance be dead pron1 murmur   pron1 be ordinal1 of those people pron1 think that if pron1 say the same thing over and over a great many time pron1 become true in the end 

suddenly a sharp dry cough be hear and pron1 all look round 

pron1 come from a tall supercilious look rocket pron1 be tie to the end of a long stick   pron1 always cough before pron1 make any observation so as to attract attention 

  person1   person1   pron1 say and pron1 listen except the poor person1 wheel pron1 be still shake pron1 head and murmur romance be dead   

  order   person1   cry out a cracker   pron1 be pron1 of a politician and have always take a prominent part in the local election so pron1 know the proper parliamentary expression to use 

  quite dead whisper the person1 wheel and pron1 go off to sleep 

as soon as pron1 be perfect silence the rocket cough a third time and begin   pron1 speak with a very slow distinct voice as if pron1 be dictate pron1 memoir and always look over the shoulder of the person to pron1 pron1 be talk   in fact pron1 have a most distinguished manner 

  how fortunate pron1 be for the king be son pron1 remark that pron1 be to be marry on the very day on which pron1 be to be let off   really if pron1 have be arrange beforehand pron1 could not have turn out well for pron1   but prince be always lucky   

  dear pron1   say the little squib pron1 think pron1 be quite the other way and that pron1 be to be let off in the prince be person1   

  pron1 may be so with pron1 pron1 answer   indeed pron1 have no doubt that pron1 be but with pron1 pron1 be different   pron1 be a very remarkable rocket and come of remarkable parent   pron1 mother be the most celebrated person1 wheel of pron1 day and be renowned for pron1 graceful dancing   when pron1 make pron1 great public appearance pron1 spin round ordinal1 time before pron1 go out and each time pron1 pron1 do so pron1 throw into the air ordinal1 pink star   pron1 be ordinal1 foot and a half in diameter and make of the very good gunpowder   pron1 father be a rocket like pron1 and of french extraction   pron1 fly so high that the people be afraid that pron1 would never come down again   pron1 do though for pron1 be of a kindly disposition and pron1 make a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain   the newspaper write about pron1 performance in very flattering term   indeed the court gazette call pron1 a triumph of pylotechnic art   

  pyrotechnic pyrotechnic pron1 mean say a bengal light   pron1 know pron1 be pyrotechnic for pron1 see pron1 write on pron1 own canister   

  well pron1 say person1 answer the rocket in a severe tone of voice and the bengal light feel so crush that pron1 begin at once to bully the little squibs in order to show that pron1 be still a person of some importance 

  pron1 be say continue the rocket pron1 be say pron1 be pron1 say   

  pron1 be talk about pron1 reply the roman candle 

  of course   pron1 know pron1 be discuss some interesting subject when pron1 be so rudely interrupted   pron1 hate rudeness and bad manner of every kind for pron1 be extremely sensitive   no one in the whole world be so sensitive as pron1 be pron1 be quite sure of that   

  pron1 be a sensitive person   say the cracker to the roman candle 

  a person pron1 because pron1 have corn pron1 always tread on other people be toe answer the roman candle in a low whisper   and the cracker nearly explode with laughter 

  pray pron1 be pron1 laugh at   person1 the rocket   pron1 be not laugh   

  pron1 be laugh because pron1 be happy reply the cracker 

  pron1 be a very selfish reason say the rocket angrily   pron1 right have pron1 to be happy   pron1 should be think about other   in fact pron1 should be think about pron1   pron1 be always think about pron1 and pron1 expect pron1 else to do the same   that be pron1 be call sympathy   pron1 be a beautiful virtue and pron1 possess pron1 in a high degree   suppose for instance pron1 happen to pron1 to night pron1 a misfortune pron1 would be for every one   the prince and princess would never be happy again pron1 whole married life would be spoil   and as for the king pron1 know pron1 would not get over pron1   really when pron1 begin to reflect on the importance of pron1 position pron1 be almost move to tear   

  if pron1 want to give pleasure to other cry the roman candle pron1 have well keep pron1 dry   

  certainly exclaim the bengal light pron1 be now in well spirit   that be only common sense   

  common sense indeed   say the rocket indignantly   pron1 forget that pron1 be very uncommon and very remarkable   why pron1 can have common sense provide that pron1 have no imagination   but pron1 have imagination for pron1 never think of thing as pron1 really be   pron1 always think of pron1 as be quite different   as for keep pron1 dry pron1 be evidently no one here pron1 can at all appreciate an emotional nature   fortunately for pron1 pron1 do not care   the only thing pron1 sustain ordinal1 through life be the consciousness of the immense inferiority of pron1 else and this be a feeling pron1 pron1 have always cultivate   but none of pron1 have any heart   here pron1 be laugh and make merry just as if the prince and princess have not just be marry   

  well really exclaim a small fire balloon why not   pron1 be a most joyful occasion and when pron1 soar up into the air pron1 intend to tell the star all about pron1   pron1 will see pron1 twinkle when pron1 talk to pron1 about the pretty bride   

  ah   pron1 a trivial view of life   say the rocket   but pron1 be only pron1 pron1 expect   pron1 be pron1 in pron1   pron1 be hollow and empty   why perhaps the prince and princess may go to live in a country where pron1 be a deep river and perhaps pron1 may have ordinal1 only son a little fair haired boy with violet eye like the prince pron1   and perhaps some day pron1 may go out to walk with pron1 nurse   and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great eld tree   and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drown   pron1 a terrible misfortune   poor people to lose pron1 only son   pron1 be really too dreadful   pron1 shall never get over pron1   

  but pron1 have not lose pron1 only son say the roman candle   no misfortune have happen to pron1 at all   

  pron1 never say that pron1 have reply the rocket   pron1 say that pron1 might   if pron1 have lose pron1 only son pron1 would be no use in say pron1 more about the matter   pron1 hate people pron1 cry over spilt milk   but when pron1 think that pron1 might lose pron1 only son pron1 certainly be very much affected   

  pron1 certainly be   cry the bengal light   in fact pron1 be the most affected person pron1 ever meet   

  pron1 be the rude person pron1 ever meet say the rocket and pron1 can not understand pron1 friendship for the person1   

  why pron1 do not even know pron1 growl the roman candle 

  pron1 never say pron1 know pron1 answer the rocket   pron1 dare say that if pron1 know pron1 pron1 should not be pron1 friend at all   pron1 be a very dangerous thing to know one be friend   

  pron1 have really well keep pron1 dry say the fire balloon   that be the important thing   

  very important for pron1 pron1 have no doubt answer the rocket but pron1 shall weep if pron1 choose     and pron1 actually burst into real tear which flow down pron1 stick like rain drop and nearly drown ordinal1 little beetle pron1 be just think of set up house together and be look for a nice dry spot to live in 

  pron1 must have a truly romantic nature say the person1 person1 for pron1 weep when pron1 be pron1 at all to weep about     and pron1 heave a deep sigh and think about the deal box 

but the roman candle and the bengal light be quite indignant and keep say person1   person1   at the top of pron1 voice   pron1 be extremely practical and whenever pron1 object to pron1 pron1 call pron1 person1 

then the moon rise like a wonderful silver shield   and the star begin to shine and a sound of music come from the palace 

the prince and princess be lead the dance   pron1 dance so beautifully that the tall white lily peep in at the window and watch pron1 and the great red poppy nod pron1 head and beat time 

then ordinal1 o clock strike and then ordinal1 and then ordinal1 and at the last stroke of midnight every one come out on the terrace and the king send for the person1 person1 

  let the firework begin say the king   and the person1 person1 make a low bow and march down to the end of the garden   pron1 have ordinal1 attendant with pron1 each of pron1 carry a light torch at the end of a long pole 

pron1 be certainly a magnificent display 

person1   person1   go the person1 wheel as pron1 spin round and round   person1   person1   go the roman candle   then the squibs dance all over the place and the bengal light make pron1 look scarlet   person1 bye cry the fire balloon as pron1 soar away drop tiny blue spark   person1   person1   answer the cracker pron1 be enjoy pron1 immensely   every one be a great success except the remarkable rocket   pron1 be so damp with cry that pron1 could not go off at all   the good thing in pron1 be the gunpowder and that be so wet with tear that pron1 be of no use   all pron1 poor relation to pron1 pron1 would never speak except with a sneer shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flower with blossom of fire   person1   person1   cry the court   and the little princess laugh with pleasure 

  pron1 suppose pron1 be reserve pron1 for some grand occasion say the rocket   no doubt that be pron1 pron1 mean and pron1 look more supercilious than ever 

the next day the workman come to put pron1 tidy   this be evidently a deputation say the rocket   pron1 will receive pron1 with become dignity so pron1 put pron1 nose in the air and begin to frown severely as if pron1 be think about some very important subject   but pron1 take no notice of pron1 at all till pron1 be just go away   then ordinal1 of pron1 catch sight of pron1   person1   pron1 cry pron1 a bad rocket   and pron1 throw pron1 over the wall into the ditch 

  bad rocket   bad rocket   pron1 say as pron1 whirl through the air   impossible   person1 rocket pron1 be pron1 the man say   bad and grand sound very much the same indeed pron1 often be the same     and pron1 fall into the mud 

  pron1 be not comfortable here pron1 remark but no doubt pron1 be some fashionable watering place and pron1 have send pron1 away to recruit pron1 health   pron1 nerve be certainly very much shattered and pron1 require rest   

then a little frog with bright jewel eye and a green mottled coat swim up to pron1 

  a new arrival pron1 see   say the frog   well after all pron1 be pron1 like mud   give pron1 rainy weather and a ditch and pron1 be quite happy   do pron1 think pron1 will be a wet afternoon   pron1 be sure pron1 hope so but the sky be quite blue and cloudless   pron1 a pity   

  person1   person1   say the rocket and pron1 begin to cough 

  pron1 a delightful voice pron1 have   cry the frog   really pron1 be quite like a croak and croaking be of course the most musical sound in the world   pron1 will hear pron1 glee club this evening   pron1 sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer be house and as soon as the moon rise pron1 begin   pron1 be so entrance that pron1 lie awake to listen to pron1   in fact pron1 be only yesterday that pron1 hear the farmer be wife say to pron1 mother that pron1 could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of pron1   pron1 be most gratifying to find pron1 so popular   

  person1   person1   say the rocket angrily   pron1 be very much annoyed that pron1 could not get a word in 

  a delightful voice certainly continue the frog   pron1 hope pron1 will come over to the duck pond   pron1 be off to look for pron1 daughter   pron1 have ordinal1 beautiful daughter and pron1 be so afraid the pike may meet pron1   pron1 be a perfect monster and would have no hesitation in breakfast off pron1   well good bye pron1 have enjoy pron1 conversation very much pron1 assure pron1   

  conversation indeed   say the rocket   pron1 have talk the whole time pron1   that be not conversation   

  pron1 must listen answer the frog and pron1 like to do all the talking pron1   pron1 save time and prevent argument   

  but pron1 like argument say the rocket 

  pron1 hope not say the frog complacently   argument be extremely vulgar for pron1 in good society hold exactly the same opinion   good bye a second time   pron1 see pron1 daughter in the distance   and the little frog swam away 

  pron1 be a very irritating person say the rocket and very ill breed   pron1 hate people pron1 talk about pron1 as pron1 do when pron1 want to talk about pron1 as pron1 do   pron1 be pron1 pron1 call selfishness and selfishness be a most detestable thing especially to any ordinal1 of pron1 temperament for pron1 be well know for pron1 sympathetic nature   in fact pron1 should take example by pron1   pron1 could not possibly have a well model   now that pron1 have the chance pron1 have well avail pron1 of pron1 for pron1 be go back to court almost immediately   pron1 be a great favourite at court   in fact the prince and princess be married yesterday in pron1 honour   of course pron1 know pron1 of these matter for pron1 be a provincial   

  pron1 be no good talk to pron1 say a dragon fly pron1 be sit on the top of a large brown bulrush   no good at all for pron1 have go away   

  well that be pron1 loss not mine answer the rocket   pron1 be not go to stop talk to pron1 merely because pron1 pay no attention   pron1 like hear pron1 talk   pron1 be ordinal1 of pron1 great pleasure   pron1 often have long conversation all by pron1 and pron1 be so clever that sometimes pron1 do not understand a single word of pron1 pron1 be say   

  then pron1 should certainly lecture on philosophy say the dragon fly   and pron1 spread a pair of lovely gauze wing and soar away into the sky 

  how very silly of pron1 not to stay here   say the rocket   pron1 be sure that pron1 have not often get such a chance of improve pron1 mind   however pron1 do not care a bit   genius like mine be sure to be appreciate some day     and pron1 sink down a little deep into the mud 

after some time a large white duck swim up to pron1   pron1 have yellow leg and webbed foot and be consider a great beauty on account of pron1 waddle 

  quack quack quack pron1 say   pron1 a curious shape pron1 be   may pron1 ask be pron1 bear like that or be pron1 the result of an accident   

  pron1 be quite evident that pron1 have always live in the country answer the rocket otherwise pron1 would know pron1 pron1 be   however pron1 excuse pron1 ignorance   pron1 would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as pron1   pron1 will no doubt be surprised to hear that pron1 can fly up into the sky and come down in a shower of golden rain   

  pron1 do not think much of that say the duck as pron1 can not see pron1 use pron1 be to any one   now if pron1 could plough the field like the ox or draw a cart like the horse or look after the sheep like the person1 dog pron1 would be pron1   

  pron1 good creature cry the rocket in a very haughty tone of voice pron1 see that pron1 belong to the low order   a person of pron1 position be never useful   pron1 have certain accomplishment and that be more than sufficient   pron1 have no sympathy pron1 with industry of any kind least of all with such industry as pron1 seem to recommend   indeed pron1 have always be of opinion that hard work be simply the refuge of people pron1 have pron1 whatever to do   

  well well say the duck pron1 be of a very peaceable disposition and never quarrel with any ordinal1 pron1 have different taste   pron1 hope at any rate pron1 pron1 be go to take up pron1 residence here   

  oh   person1 no cry the rocket   pron1 be merely a visitor a distinguished visitor   the fact be that pron1 find this place rather tedious   pron1 be neither society here nor solitude   in fact pron1 be essentially suburban   pron1 shall probably go back to court for pron1 know that pron1 be destine to make a sensation in the world   

  pron1 have thought of enter public life once pron1 remark the duck   pron1 be so many thing pron1 need reform   indeed pron1 take the chair at a meeting some time ago and pron1 pass resolution condemn pron1 pron1 pron1 do not like   however pron1 do not seem to have much effect   now pron1 go in for domesticity and look after pron1 family   

  pron1 be make for public life say the rocket and so be all pron1 relation even the humble of pron1   whenever pron1 appear pron1 excite great attention   pron1 have not actually appear pron1 but when pron1 do so pron1 will be a magnificent sight   as for domesticity pron1 age ordinal1 rapidly and distract ordinal1 be mind from high thing   

  ah   the high thing of life how fine pron1 be   say the duck   and that remind pron1 how hungry pron1 feel and pron1 swam away down the stream say quack quack quack   

  come back   come back   scream the rocket pron1 have a great deal to say to pron1     but the duck pay no attention to pron1   pron1 be glad that pron1 have go pron1 say to pron1 pron1 have a decidedly middle class mind     and pron1 sink a little deeply still into the mud and begin to think about the loneliness of genius when suddenly ordinal1 little boy in white smock come run down the bank with a kettle and some faggot 

  this must be the deputation say the rocket and pron1 try to look very dignified 

  person1   cry ordinal1 of the boy look at this old stick   pron1 wonder how pron1 come here     and pron1 pick the rocket out of the ditch 

  old stick   say the rocket impossible   gold stick pron1 be pron1 pron1 say   person1 stick be very complimentary   in fact pron1 mistake pron1 for ordinal1 of the court dignitary   

  let pron1 put pron1 into the fire   say the other boy pron1 will help to boil the kettle   

so pron1 pile the faggot together and put the rocket on top and light the fire 

  this be magnificent cry the rocket pron1 be go to let pron1 off in broad day light so that every one can see pron1   

  pron1 will go to sleep now pron1 say and when pron1 wake up the kettle will be boil     and pron1 lie down on the grass and shut pron1 eye 

the rocket be very damp so pron1 take a long time to burn   at last however the fire catch pron1 

  now pron1 be go off   pron1 cry and pron1 make pron1 very stiff and straight   pron1 know pron1 shall go much high than the star much high than the moon much high than the sun   in fact pron1 shall go so high that 

fizz   person1   fizz   and pron1 go straight up into the air 

  delightful   pron1 cry pron1 shall go on like this for ever   pron1 a success pron1 be   

but pron1 see pron1 

then pron1 begin to feel a curious tingling sensation all over pron1 

  now pron1 be go to explode pron1 cry   pron1 shall set the whole world on fire and make such a noise that pron1 will talk about pron1 else for a whole year   and pron1 certainly do explode   person1   person1   person1   go the gunpowder   pron1 be no doubt about pron1 

but pron1 hear pron1 not even the ordinal1 little boy for pron1 be sound asleep 

then all pron1 be leave of pron1 be the stick and this fall down on the back of a goose pron1 be take a walk by the side of the ditch 

  good heaven   cry the goose   pron1 be go to rain stick     and pron1 rush into the water 

  pron1 know pron1 should create a great sensation gasp the rocket and pron1 go out
