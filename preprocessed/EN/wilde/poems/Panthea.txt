person1 
nay let pron1 walk from fire unto fire 
from passionate pain to deadly delight 
pron1 be too young to live without desire 
too young art thou to waste this summer night 
ask those idle question which of old 
man seek of person1 and person1 and no reply be tell 

for sweet to feel be well than to know 
and wisdom be a childless heritage 
ordinal1 pulse of passion youth be first fiery glow 
be worth the hoarded proverb of the sage 
person1 not pron1 soul with dead philosophy 
have pron1 not lip to kiss with heart to love and eye to see 

person1 thou not hear the murmur nightingale 
like water bubble from a silver jar 
so soft pron1 sing the envious moon be pale 
that high in person1 pron1 be hang so far 
pron1 can not hear that love enrapture tune 
person1 how pron1 wreathe each horn with mist person1 late and labour moon 

white lily in whose cup the gold bee dream 
the fall snow of petal where the breeze 
scatter the chestnut blossom or the gleam 
of boyish limb in water be not these 
enough for pron1 dost person1 desire more 
alas   the god will give nought else from pron1 eternal store 

for pron1 high god have sick and weary grow 
of all pron1 endless sin pron1 vain endeavour 
for wasted day of youth to make atone 
by pain or prayer or priest and never never 
hearken pron1 now to either good or ill 
but send pron1 rain upon the just and the unjust at will 

pron1 sit at ease pron1 god pron1 sit at ease 
strew with leave of rise pron1 scented wine 
pron1 sleep pron1 sleep beneath the rock tree 
where person1 and yellow person1 person1 
mourn the old glad day before pron1 know 
pron1 evil thing the heart of man could dream and dream do 

and far beneath the brazen floor pron1 see 
like swarm fly the crowd of little man 
the bustle of small life then wearily 
back to pron1 lotus haunt pron1 turn again 
kiss each other mouth and mix more deep 
the poppy seed draught which bring soft purple lidded sleep 

there all day long the golden person1 person1 
pron1 torch bearer stand with pron1 torch ablaze 
and when the gaudy web of noon be spin 
by pron1 ordinal1 maiden through the crimson haze 
fresh from endymion be arm come forth the moon 
and the immortal god in toil of mortal passion swoon 

pron1 walk queen person1 through some dewy mead 
pron1 grand white foot fleck with the saffron dust 
of wind stir lily while young ganymede 
person1 in the hot and amber foaming must 
pron1 curl all toss as when the eagle bare 
the frightened boy from person1 through the person1 person1 air 

there in the green heart of some garden close 
person1 person1 with the shepherd at pron1 side 
pron1 warm soft body like the briar rise 
which would be white yet blush at pron1 pride 
laugh low for love till jealous person1 
peer through the myrtle leave and sigh for pain of lonely bliss 

pron1 never do that dreary north wind blow 
which leave pron1 english forest bleak and bare 
nor ever fall the swift white feather snow 
nor ever doth the red toothed lightning dare 
to wake pron1 in the silver fret night 
when pron1 lie weep for some sweet sad sin some dead delight 

alas   pron1 know the far lethæan spring 
the violet hide water well pron1 know 
where ordinal1 whose foot with tired wander 
be faint and broken may take heart and go 
and from those dark depth cool and crystalline 
drink and draw balm and sleep for sleepless soul and anodyne 

but pron1 oppress pron1 nature person1 or fate 
be pron1 enemy pron1 starve and feed 
on vain repentance o pron1 be bear too late 
what balm for pron1 in bruisèd person1 seed 
pron1 crowd into ordinal1 finite pulse of time 
the joy of infinite love and the fierce pain of infinite crime 

o pron1 be weary of this sense of guilt 
person1 of pleasure be paramour despair 
person1 of every temple pron1 have build 
person1 of every right unanswered prayer 
for man be weak   person1 sleep and person1 be high 
ordinal1 fiery coloured moment ordinal1 great love   and lo   pron1 die 

ah   but no ferry man with labour pole 
near pron1 black shallop to the flowerless strand 
no little coin of bronze can bring the soul 
over death be river to the sunless land 
victim and wine and vow be all in vain 
the tomb be seal   the soldier watch   the dead rise not again 

pron1 be resolve into the person1 person1 
pron1 be make ordinal1 with pron1 pron1 touch and see 
with pron1 heart be blood each crimson sun be fair 
with pron1 young life each spring impassioned tree 
flame into green the wild beast pron1 range 
the moor pron1 kinsman be all life be ordinal1 and all be change 

with beat of systole and of diastole 
ordinal1 grand great life throb through earth be giant heart 
and mighty wave of single being roll 
from nerveless germ to man for pron1 be part 
of every rock and bird and beast and hill 
ordinal1 with the thing pron1 prey on pron1 and ordinal1 with pron1 pron1 kill 

from low cell of wake life pron1 pass 
to full perfection   thus the world grow old 
pron1 pron1 be godlike now be once a mass 
of quiver purple fleck with bar of gold 
unsentient or of joy or misery 
and toss in terrible tangle of some wild and wind sweep sea 

this hot hard flame with which pron1 body burn 
will make some meadow blaze with daffodil 
ay   and those argent breast of thine will turn 
to water lily   the brown field man till 
will be more fruitful for pron1 love to night 
pron1 be lose in nature all thing live in death be despite 

the boy be first kiss the hyacinth be first bell 
the man be last passion and the last red spear 
that from the lily leap the asphodel 
which will not let pron1 blossom blow for fear 
of too much beauty and the timid shame 
of the young bridegroom at pron1 lover be eye these with the same 

ordinal1 sacrament be consecrate the earth 
not pron1 alone hath passion hymeneal 
the yellow buttercup pron1 shake for mirth 
at daybreak know a pleasure not less real 
than pron1 do when in some fresh blossom wood 
pron1 draw the spring into pron1 heart and feel that life be good 

so when man bury pron1 beneath the yew 
thy crimson stainèd person1 a rose will be 
and pron1 soft eye lush bluebell dim with dew 
and when the white narcissus wantonly 
kiss the wind pron1 playmate some faint joy 
will thrill pron1 dust and pron1 will be again fond maid and boy 

and thus without life be conscious torture pain 
in some sweet flower pron1 will feel the sun 
and from the linnet be throat will sing again 
and as ordinal1 gorgeous mailèd snake will run 
over pron1 grave or as ordinal1 tiger creep 
through the hot jungle where the person1 eyed huge lion sleep 

and give pron1 battle   how pron1 heart leaps up 
to think of that grand living after death 
in beast and bird and flower when this cup 
be fill too full of spirit burst for breath 
and with the pale leave of some autumn day 
the soul earth be early conqueror become earth be last great prey 

o think of pron1   pron1 shall inform pron1 
into all sensuous life the person1 foot person1 
the centaur or the merry bright eyed elf 
that leave pron1 dancing ring to spite the dawn 
upon the meadow shall not be more near 
than pron1 and pron1 to nature be mystery for pron1 shall hear 

the thrush be heart beat and the daisy grow 
and the person1 snowdrop sigh for the sun 
on sunless day in winter pron1 shall know 
by pron1 the silver gossamer be spin 
pron1 paint the diapered fritillary 
on pron1 wide wing from shiver pine to pine the eagle fly 

ay   have pron1 never love at all pron1 know 
if yonder daffodil have lure the bee 
into pron1 gilded womb or any rose 
have hang with crimson lamp pron1 little tree 
methink no leaf would ever bud in spring 
but for the lover lip pron1 kiss the poet lip pron1 sing 

be the light vanish from pron1 golden sun 
or be this dædal fashioned earth less fair 
that pron1 be nature be heritor and ordinal1 
with every pulse of life pron1 beat the air 
rather new sun across the sky shall pass 
new splendour come unto the flower new glory to the grass 

and pron1 ordinal1 lover shall not sit afar 
critic of nature but the joyous sea 
shall be pron1 raiment and the bearded star 
shoot arrow at pron1 pleasure   pron1 shall be 
part of the mighty universal whole 
and through all æon mix and mingle with the kosmic soul 

pron1 shall be note in that great symphony 
whose cadence circle through the rhythmic sphere 
and all the live world be throb heart shall be 
ordinal1 with pron1 heart   the stealthy creeping year 
have lose pron1 terror now pron1 shall not die 
the universe pron1 shall be pron1 immortality
