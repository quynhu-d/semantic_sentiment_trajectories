chapter pron1 
the studio be fill with the rich odour of rose and when the light summer wind stir amidst the tree of the garden there come through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pink flowering thorn 

from the corner of the person1 of persian saddle bag on which pron1 be lie smoke as be pron1 custom innumerable cigarette person1 person1 person1 could just catch the gleam of the honey sweet and honey coloured blossom of a laburnum whose tremulous branch seem hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as pron1   and now and then the fantastic shadow of bird in flight flit across the long tussore silk curtain pron1 be stretch in front of the huge window produce a kind of momentary japanese effect and make pron1 think of those pallid jade face painter of person1 pron1 through the medium of an art pron1 be necessarily immobile seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion   the sullen murmur of the bee shoulder pron1 way through the long unmown grass or circle with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horn of the straggle woodbine seem to make the stillness more oppressive   the dim roar of person1 be like the bourdon note of a distant organ 

in the centre of the room clamp to an upright easel stand the full length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty and in front of pron1 some little distance away be sit the artist pron1 person1 person1 whose sudden disappearance some year ago cause at the time such public excitement and give rise to so many strange conjecture 

as the painter look at the gracious and comely form pron1 have so skilfully mirror in pron1 art a smile of pleasure pass across pron1 face and seem about to linger there   but pron1 suddenly start up and close pron1 eye place pron1 finger upon the lid as though pron1 seek to imprison within pron1 brain some curious dream from which pron1 fear pron1 might awake 

  pron1 be pron1 good work basil the good thing pron1 have ever do say person1 person1 languidly   pron1 must certainly send pron1 next year to the grosvenor   the academy be too large and too vulgar   whenever pron1 have go there pron1 have be either so many people pron1 pron1 have not be able to see the picture which be dreadful or so many picture pron1 pron1 have not be able to see the people which be bad   the grosvenor be really the only place   

  pron1 do not think pron1 shall send pron1 anywhere pron1 answer toss pron1 head back in that odd way pron1 use to make pron1 friend laugh at pron1 at person1   no pron1 will not send pron1 anywhere   

person1 person1 elevate pron1 eyebrow and look at pron1 in amazement through the thin blue wreath of smoke pron1 curl up in such fanciful whorls from pron1 heavy opium taint cigarette   not send pron1 anywhere   pron1 dear fellow why   have pron1 any reason   pron1 odd chap pron1 painter be   pron1 do pron1 in the world to gain a reputation   as soon as pron1 have ordinal1 pron1 seem to want to throw pron1 away   pron1 be silly of pron1 for pron1 be only ordinal1 thing in the world bad than be talk about and that be not be talk about   a portrait like this would set pron1 far above all the young man in person1 and make the old man quite jealous if old man be ever capable of any emotion   

  pron1 know pron1 will laugh at pron1 pron1 reply but pron1 really can not exhibit pron1   pron1 have put too much of pron1 into pron1   

person1 person1 stretch pron1 out on the person1 and laugh 

  yes pron1 know pron1 would   but pron1 be quite true all the same   

  too much of pron1 in pron1   upon pron1 word basil pron1 do not know pron1 be so vain   and pron1 really can not see any resemblance between pron1 with pron1 rugged strong face and pron1 coal black hair and this young adoni pron1 look as if pron1 be make out of ivory and rise leave   why pron1 dear basil pron1 be a narcissus and pron1 well of course pron1 have an intellectual expression and all that   but beauty real beauty end where an intellectual expression begin   person1 be in pron1 a mode of exaggeration and destroy the harmony of any face   the moment one sit down to think pron1 become all nose or all forehead or pron1 horrid   look at the successful man in any of the learn profession   how perfectly hideous pron1 be   except of course in the church   but then in the church pron1 do not think   a bishop keep on say at the age of ordinal1 pron1 pron1 be tell to say when pron1 be a boy of ordinal1 and as a natural consequence pron1 always look absolutely delightful   pron1 mysterious young friend whose name pron1 have never tell pron1 but whose picture really fascinate pron1 never think   pron1 feel quite sure of that   pron1 be some brainless beautiful creature pron1 should be always here in winter when pron1 have no flower to look at and always here in summer when pron1 want pron1 to chill pron1 intelligence   do not flatter pron1 basil pron1 be not in the least like pron1   

  pron1 do not understand pron1 person1 answer the artist   of course pron1 be not like pron1   pron1 know that perfectly well   indeed pron1 should be sorry to look like pron1   pron1 shrug pron1 shoulder   pron1 be tell pron1 the truth   pron1 be a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction the sort of fatality pron1 seem to dog through history the falter step of king   pron1 be well not to be different from ordinal1 be fellow   the ugly and the stupid have the good of pron1 in this world   pron1 can sit at pron1 ease and gape at the play   if pron1 know pron1 of victory pron1 be at least spare the knowledge of defeat   pron1 live as pron1 all should live undisturbed indifferent and without person1   pron1 neither bring ruin upon other nor ever receive pron1 from alien hand   pron1 rank and person1 person1   pron1 brain such as pron1 be pron1 art whatever pron1 may be worth   dorian gray be good look pron1 shall all suffer for pron1 the god have give pron1 suffer terribly   

  dorian gray   be that pron1 name   ask person1 person1 walk across the studio towards person1 person1 

  yes that be pron1 name   pron1 do not intend to tell pron1 to pron1   

  but why not   

  oh pron1 can not explain   when pron1 like people immensely pron1 never tell pron1 name to any one   pron1 be like surrender a part of pron1   pron1 have grow to love secrecy   pron1 seem to be the ordinal1 thing pron1 can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to pron1   the commonest thing be delightful if pron1 only hide pron1   when pron1 leave town now pron1 never tell pron1 people where pron1 be go   if pron1 do pron1 would lose all pron1 pleasure   pron1 be a silly habit pron1 dare say but somehow pron1 seem to bring a great deal of romance into ordinal1 be life   pron1 suppose pron1 think pron1 awfully foolish about pron1   

  not at all answer person1 person1 not at all pron1 dear basil   pron1 seem to forget that pron1 be married and the ordinal1 charm of marriage be that pron1 make a life of deception absolutely necessary for both party   pron1 never know where pron1 wife be and pron1 wife never know pron1 pron1 be do   when pron1 meet pron1 do meet occasionally when pron1 dine out together or go down to the duke be pron1 tell each other the most absurd story with the most serious face   pron1 wife be very good at pron1 much well in fact than pron1 be   pron1 never get confused over pron1 date and pron1 always do   but when pron1 do find pron1 out pron1 make no row at all   pron1 sometimes wish pron1 would   but pron1 merely laugh at pron1   

  pron1 hate the way pron1 talk about pron1 married person1 person1 say person1 person1 stroll towards the door pron1 lead into the garden   pron1 believe that pron1 be really a very good husband but that pron1 be thoroughly ashamed of pron1 own virtue   pron1 be an extraordinary fellow   pron1 never say a moral thing and pron1 never do a wrong thing   pron1 cynicism be simply a pose   

  be natural be simply a pose and the most irritating pose pron1 know cry person1 person1 laugh   and the ordinal1 young man go out into the garden together and ensconce pron1 on a long bamboo seat pron1 stand in the shade of a tall person1 person1   the sunlight slip over the polished leave   in the grass white daisy be tremulous 

after a pause person1 person1 pull out pron1 watch   pron1 be afraid pron1 must be go basil pron1 murmur and before pron1 go pron1 insist on pron1 answer a question pron1 put to pron1 some time ago   

  pron1 be that   say the painter keep pron1 eye fix on the ground 

  pron1 know quite well   

  pron1 do not person1   

  well pron1 will tell pron1 pron1 pron1 be   pron1 want pron1 to explain to pron1 why pron1 will not exhibit dorian gray be picture   pron1 want the real reason   

  pron1 tell pron1 the real reason   

  no pron1 do not   pron1 say pron1 be because pron1 be too much of pron1 in pron1   now that be childish   

  person1 say person1 person1 look pron1 straight in the face every portrait pron1 be paint with feeling be a portrait of the artist not of the sitter   the sitter be merely the accident the occasion   pron1 be not pron1 pron1 be reveal by the painter   pron1 be rather the painter pron1 on the coloured canvas reveal pron1   the reason pron1 will not exhibit this picture be that pron1 be afraid that pron1 have show in pron1 the secret of pron1 own soul   

person1 person1 laugh   and pron1 be that   pron1 ask 

  pron1 will tell pron1 say hallward   but an expression of perplexity come over pron1 face 

  pron1 be all expectation basil continue pron1 companion glance at pron1 

  oh pron1 be really very little to tell person1 answer the painter   and pron1 be afraid pron1 will hardly understand pron1   perhaps pron1 will hardly believe pron1   

person1 person1 smile and lean down pluck a pink petalle daisy from the grass and examine pron1   pron1 be quite sure pron1 shall understand pron1 pron1 reply gaze intently at the little golden white feather disk and as for believe thing pron1 can believe pron1 provide that pron1 be quite incredible   

the wind shake some blossom from the tree and the heavy person1 bloom with pron1 cluster star move to and fro in the languid air   a grasshopper begin to chirrup by the wall and like a blue thread a long thin dragon fly float past on pron1 brown gauze wing   person1 person1 feel as if pron1 could hear basil hallward be heart beat and wonder pron1 be come 

  the story be simply this say the painter after some time   ordinal1 month ago pron1 go to a crush at person1 person1 be   pron1 know pron1 poor artist have to show pron1 in society from time to time just to remind the public that pron1 be not savage   with an evening coat and a white tie as pron1 tell pron1 once pron1 even a stock broker can gain a reputation for be civilized   well after pron1 have be in the room about ordinal1 minute talk to huge overdressed dowager and tedious academician pron1 suddenly become conscious that some one be look at pron1   pron1 turn half way round and see dorian gray for the first time   when pron1 eye meet pron1 feel that pron1 be grow pale   a curious sensation of terror come over pron1   pron1 know that pron1 have come face to face with some one whose mere personality be so fascinating that if pron1 allow pron1 to do so pron1 would absorb pron1 whole nature pron1 whole soul pron1 very art pron1   pron1 do not want any external influence in pron1 life   pron1 know pron1 person1 how independent pron1 be by nature   pron1 have always be pron1 own master   have at least always be so till pron1 meet dorian gray   then but pron1 do not know how to explain pron1 to pron1   pron1 seem to tell pron1 that pron1 be on the verge of a terrible crisis in pron1 life   pron1 have a strange feeling that fate have in store for pron1 exquisite joy and exquisite sorrow   pron1 grow afraid and turn to quit the room   pron1 be not conscience pron1 make pron1 do so pron1 be a sort of cowardice   pron1 take no credit to pron1 for try to escape   

  conscience and cowardice be really the same thing basil   person1 be the trade name of the firm   that be all   

  pron1 do not believe that person1 and pron1 do not believe pron1 do either   however whatever be pron1 motive and pron1 may have be pride for pron1 use to be very proud pron1 certainly struggle to the door   there of course pron1 stumble against lady person1   pron1 be not go to run away so soon person1   person1   pron1 scream out   pron1 know pron1 curiously shrill voice   

  yes   pron1 be a peacock in pron1 but beauty say person1 person1 pull the daisy to bit with pron1 long nervous finger 

  pron1 could not get rid of pron1   pron1 bring pron1 up to royalty and people with star and garter and elderly lady with gigantic tiara and parrot nose   pron1 speak of pron1 as pron1 dear friend   pron1 have only meet pron1 once before but pron1 take pron1 into pron1 head to lionize pron1   pron1 believe some picture of mine have make a great success at the time at least have be chatter about in the penny newspaper which be the nineteenth century standard of immortality   suddenly pron1 find pron1 face to face with the young man whose personality have so strangely stir pron1   pron1 be quite close almost touching   pron1 eye meet again   pron1 be reckless of pron1 but pron1 ask lady person1 to introduce pron1 to pron1   perhaps pron1 be not so reckless after all   pron1 be simply inevitable   pron1 would have speak to each other without any introduction   pron1 be sure of that   person1 tell pron1 so afterwards   pron1 too feel that pron1 be destine to know each other   

  and how do person1 person1 describe this wonderful young man   ask pron1 companion   pron1 know pron1 go in for give a rapid précis of all pron1 guest   pron1 remember pron1 bring pron1 up to a truculent and red faced old gentleman cover all over with order and ribbon and hiss into pron1 ear in a tragic whisper which must have be perfectly audible to pron1 in the room the most astounding detail   pron1 simply flee   pron1 like to find out people for pron1   but lady person1 treat pron1 guest exactly as an auctioneer treat pron1 good   pron1 either explain pron1 entirely away or tell ordinal1 pron1 about pron1 except pron1 one want to know   

  poor lady person1   pron1 be hard on pron1 person1   person1 person1 listlessly 

  pron1 dear fellow pron1 try to found a salon and only succeed in open a restaurant   how could pron1 admire pron1   but tell pron1 pron1 do pron1 say about person1   person1 gray   

  oh pron1 like charming boy poor dear mother and pron1 absolutely inseparable   quite forget pron1 pron1 do afraid pron1 do not do pron1 oh yes play the piano or be pron1 the violin dear person1   person1   neither of pron1 could help laugh and pron1 become friend at once   

  laughter be not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and pron1 be far the good ending for ordinal1 say the young person1 pluck another daisy 

person1 shake pron1 head   pron1 do not understand pron1 friendship be person1 pron1 murmur or what enmity be for that matter   pron1 like every ordinal1   that be to say pron1 be indifferent to every ordinal1   

  how horribly unjust of pron1   cry person1 person1 tilt pron1 hat back and look up at the little cloud pron1 like ravelled skein of glossy white silk be drift across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky   yes   horribly unjust of pron1   pron1 make a great difference between people   pron1 choose pron1 friend for pron1 good look pron1 acquaintance for pron1 good character and pron1 enemy for pron1 good intellect   a man can not be too careful in the choice of pron1 enemy   pron1 have not get ordinal1 pron1 be a fool   pron1 be all man of some intellectual power and consequently pron1 all appreciate pron1   be that very vain of pron1   pron1 think pron1 be rather vain   

  pron1 should think pron1 be person1   but accord to pron1 category pron1 must be merely an acquaintance   

  pron1 dear old basil pron1 be much more than an acquaintance   

  and much less than a friend   a sort of brother pron1 suppose   

  oh brother   pron1 do not care for brother   pron1 elder brother will not die and pron1 young brother seem never to do pron1 else   

  person1   person1 hallward frown 

  pron1 dear fellow pron1 be not quite serious   but pron1 can not help detest pron1 relation   pron1 suppose pron1 come from the fact that none of pron1 can stand other people have the same fault as pron1   pron1 quite sympathize with the rage of the english democracy against pron1 pron1 call the vice of the upper order   the masse feel that drunkenness stupidity and immorality should be pron1 own special property and that if any ordinal1 of pron1 make an ass of pron1 pron1 be poach on pron1 preserve   when poor southwark get into the divorce court pron1 indignation be quite magnificent   and yet pron1 do not suppose that ordinal1 per cent of the person1 live correctly   

  pron1 do not agree with a single word pron1 pron1 have say and pron1 be more person1 pron1 feel sure pron1 do not either   

person1 person1 stroke pron1 point brown beard and tap the toe of pron1 patent leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane   how english pron1 be basil   that be the second time pron1 have make that observation   if pron1 put forward an idea to a true englishman always a rash thing to do pron1 never dream of consider whether the idea be right or wrong   the only thing pron1 consider of any importance be whether pron1 believe pron1 pron1   now the value of an idea have pron1 whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man pron1 express pron1   indeed the probability be that the more insincere the man be the more purely intellectual will the idea be as in that case pron1 will not be colour by either pron1 want pron1 desire or pron1 prejudice   however pron1 do not propose to discuss politics sociology or metaphysics with pron1   pron1 like person well than principle and pron1 like person with no principle well than pron1 else in the world   tell pron1 more about person1   person1 gray   how often do pron1 see pron1   

  every day   pron1 could not be happy if pron1 do not see pron1 every day   pron1 be absolutely necessary to pron1   

  how extraordinary   pron1 think pron1 would never care for pron1 but pron1 art   

  pron1 be all pron1 art to pron1 now say the painter gravely   pron1 sometimes think person1 that pron1 be only ordinal1 era of any importance in the world be history   the first be the appearance of a new medium for art and the second be the appearance of a new personality for art also   pron1 the invention of oil painting be to the venetian the face of antinous be to late greek sculpture and the face of dorian gray will some day be to pron1   pron1 be not merely that pron1 paint from pron1 draw from pron1 sketch from pron1   of course pron1 have do all that   but pron1 be much more to pron1 than a model or a sitter   pron1 will not tell pron1 that pron1 be dissatisfied with pron1 pron1 have do of pron1 or that pron1 beauty be such that art can not express pron1   pron1 be pron1 pron1 art can not express and pron1 know that the work pron1 have do since pron1 meet dorian gray be good work be the good work of pron1 life   but in some curious way pron1 wonder will pron1 understand pron1   pron1 personality have suggest to pron1 an entirely new manner in art an entirely new mode of style   pron1 see thing differently pron1 think of pron1 differently   pron1 can now recreate life in a way pron1 be hide from pron1 before   a dream of form in day of thought pron1 be pron1 pron1 say that   pron1 forget   but pron1 be pron1 dorian gray have be to pron1   the merely visible presence of this lad for pron1 seem to pron1 little more than a lad though pron1 be really over ordinal1 pron1 merely visible presence ah   pron1 wonder can pron1 realize all pron1 that mean   unconsciously pron1 define for pron1 the line of a fresh school a school pron1 be to have in pron1 all the passion of the romantic spirit all the perfection of the spirit pron1 be greek   the harmony of soul and body how much that be   pron1 in pron1 madness have separate the ordinal1 and have invent a realism pron1 be vulgar an ideality pron1 be void   person1   if pron1 only know pron1 dorian gray be to pron1   pron1 remember that landscape of mine for which person1 offer pron1 such a huge price but which pron1 would not part with   pron1 be ordinal1 of the good thing pron1 have ever do   and why be pron1 so   because while pron1 be paint pron1 dorian gray sit beside pron1   some subtle influence pass from pron1 to pron1 and for the first time in pron1 life pron1 see in the plain woodland the wonder pron1 have always look for and always miss   

  basil this be extraordinary   pron1 must see dorian gray   

person1 get up from the seat and walk up and down the garden   after some time pron1 come back   person1 pron1 say dorian gray be to pron1 simply a motive in art   pron1 might see pron1 in pron1   pron1 see pron1 in pron1   pron1 be never more present in pron1 work than when no image of pron1 be there   pron1 be a suggestion as pron1 have say of a new manner   pron1 find pron1 in the curve of certain line in the loveliness and subtlety of certain colour   that be all   

  then why will not pron1 exhibit pron1 portrait   ask person1 person1 

  because without intend pron1 pron1 have put into pron1 some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry of which of course pron1 have never care to speak to pron1   pron1 know pron1 about pron1   pron1 shall never know pron1 about pron1   but the world might guess pron1 and pron1 will not bare pron1 soul to pron1 shallow pry eye   pron1 heart shall never be put under pron1 microscope   pron1 be too much of pron1 in the thing person1 too much of pron1   

  poet be not so scrupulous as pron1 be   pron1 know how useful passion be for publication   nowadays a broken heart will run to many edition   

  pron1 hate pron1 for pron1 cry hallward   an artist should create beautiful thing but should put pron1 of pron1 own life into pron1   pron1 live in an age when man treat art as if pron1 be mean to be a form of autobiography   pron1 have lose the abstract sense of beauty   some day pron1 will show the world pron1 pron1 be   and for that reason the world shall never see pron1 portrait of dorian gray   

  pron1 think pron1 be wrong basil but pron1 will not argue with pron1   pron1 be only the intellectually lose pron1 ever argue   tell pron1 be dorian gray very fond of pron1   

the painter consider for a few moment   pron1 like pron1 pron1 answer after a pause   pron1 know pron1 like pron1   of course pron1 flatter pron1 dreadfully   pron1 find a strange pleasure in say thing to pron1 that pron1 know pron1 shall be sorry for have say   as a rule pron1 be charming to pron1 and pron1 sit in the studio and talk of a ordinal1 thing   now and then however pron1 be horribly thoughtless and seem to take a real delight in give pron1 pain   then pron1 feel person1 that pron1 have give away pron1 whole soul to some one pron1 treat pron1 as if pron1 be a flower to put in pron1 coat a bit of decoration to charm pron1 vanity an ornament for a summer be day   

  day in summer basil be apt to linger murmur person1 person1   perhaps pron1 will tire soon than pron1 will   pron1 be a sad thing to think of but pron1 be no doubt that genius last long than beauty   that account for the fact that pron1 all take such pain to over educate pron1   in the wild struggle for existence pron1 want to have pron1 pron1 endure and so pron1 fill pron1 mind with rubbish and fact in the silly hope of keep pron1 place   the thoroughly well informed man pron1 be the modern ideal   and the mind of the thoroughly well informed man be a dreadful thing   pron1 be like a bric à brac shop all monster and dust with pron1 price above pron1 proper value   pron1 think pron1 will tire first all the same   some day pron1 will look at pron1 friend and pron1 will seem to pron1 to be a little out of drawing or pron1 will not like pron1 tone of colour or pron1   pron1 will bitterly reproach pron1 in pron1 own heart and seriously think that pron1 have behave very badly to pron1   the next time pron1 call pron1 will be perfectly cold and indifferent   pron1 will be a great pity for pron1 will alter pron1   pron1 pron1 have tell pron1 be quite a romance a romance of art pron1 might call pron1 and the bad of have a romance of any kind be that pron1 leave ordinal1 so unromantic   

  person1 do not talk like that   as long as pron1 live the personality of dorian gray will dominate pron1   pron1 can not feel pron1 pron1 feel   pron1 change too often   

  ah pron1 dear basil pron1 be exactly why pron1 can feel pron1   those pron1 be faithful know only the trivial side of love pron1 be the faithless pron1 know love be tragedy   and person1 person1 strike a light on a dainty silver case and begin to smoke a cigarette with a self conscious and satisfied air as if pron1 have sum up the world in a phrase   pron1 be a rustle of chirrup sparrow in the green lacquer leave of the ivy and the blue cloud shadow chase pron1 across the grass like swallow   how pleasant pron1 be in the garden   and how delightful other people be emotion be   much more delightful than pron1 idea pron1 seem to pron1   ordinal1 be own soul and the passion of ordinal1 be friend those be the fascinating thing in life   pron1 picture to pron1 with silent amusement the tedious luncheon pron1 pron1 have miss by stay so long with person1 person1   have pron1 go to pron1 aunt be pron1 would have be sure to have meet person1 person1 there and the whole conversation would have be about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging house   each class would have preach the importance of those virtue for whose exercise pron1 be no necessity in pron1 own life   the rich would have speak on the value of thrift and the idle grow eloquent over the dignity of labour   pron1 be charming to have escape all that   as pron1 think of pron1 aunt an idea seem to strike pron1   pron1 turn to hallward and say pron1 dear fellow pron1 have just remember

person1 person1 look at pron1   yes pron1 be certainly wonderfully handsome with pron1 finely curved scarlet lip pron1 frank blue eye pron1 crisp gold hair   pron1 be pron1 in pron1 face pron1 make ordinal1 trust pron1 at once   all the candour of youth be there as well as all youth be passionate purity   ordinal1 feel that pron1 have keep pron1 unspotted from the world   no wonder person1 person1 worship pron1 

  pron1 be too charming to go in for philanthropy person1   person1 far too charming   and person1 person1 fling pron1 down on the person1 and open pron1 cigarette case 

the painter have be busy mix pron1 colour and get pron1 brush ready   pron1 be look worried and when pron1 hear person1 person1 be last remark pron1 glance at pron1 hesitate for a moment and then say person1 pron1 want to finish this picture to day   would pron1 think pron1 awfully rude of pron1 if pron1 ask pron1 to go away   

person1 person1 smile and look at dorian gray   be pron1 to go person1   person1   pron1 ask 

  oh please do not person1 person1   pron1 see that basil be in ordinal1 of pron1 sulky mood and pron1 can not bear pron1 when pron1 sulks   besides pron1 want pron1 to tell pron1 why pron1 should not go in for philanthropy   

  pron1 do not know that pron1 shall tell pron1 that person1   person1   pron1 be so tedious a subject that pron1 would have to talk seriously about pron1   but pron1 certainly shall not run away now that pron1 have ask pron1 to stop   pron1 do not really mind basil do pron1   pron1 have often tell pron1 that pron1 like pron1 sitter to have some ordinal1 to chat to   

person1 bite pron1 lip   if dorian wish pron1 of course pron1 must stay   person1 be whim be law to pron1 except pron1   

person1 person1 take up pron1 hat and glove   pron1 be very press basil but pron1 be afraid pron1 must go   pron1 have promise to meet a man at the person1   good bye person1   person1   come and see pron1 some afternoon in person1 person1   pron1 be nearly always at home at ordinal1 o clock   write to pron1 when pron1 be come   pron1 should be sorry to miss pron1   

  basil cry dorian gray if person1 person1 person1 go pron1 shall go too   pron1 never open pron1 lip while pron1 be paint and pron1 be horribly dull standing on a platform and try to look pleasant   ask pron1 to stay   pron1 insist upon pron1   

  stay person1 to oblige person1 and to oblige pron1 say hallward gaze intently at pron1 picture   pron1 be quite true pron1 never talk when pron1 be work and never listen either and pron1 must be dreadfully tedious for pron1 unfortunate sitter   pron1 beg pron1 to stay   

  but pron1 about pron1 man at the person1   

the painter laugh   pron1 do not think pron1 will be any difficulty about that   sit down again person1   and now dorian get up on the platform and do not move about too much or pay any attention to pron1 person1 person1 say   pron1 have a very bad influence over all pron1 friend with the single exception of pron1   

dorian gray step up on the dai with the air of a young greek martyr and make a little moue of discontent to person1 person1 to pron1 pron1 have rather take a fancy   pron1 be so unlike basil   pron1 make a delightful contrast   and pron1 have such a beautiful voice   after a few moment pron1 say to pron1 have pron1 really a very bad influence person1 person1   as bad as basil say   

  pron1 be no such thing as a good influence person1   person1   all influence be immoral immoral from the scientific point of view   

  why   

  because to influence a person be to give pron1 one be own soul   pron1 do not think pron1 natural thought or burn with pron1 natural passion   pron1 virtue be not real to pron1   pron1 sin if pron1 be such thing as sin be borrow   pron1 become an echo of some one else be music an actor of a part pron1 have not be write for pron1   the aim of life be self development   to realize ordinal1 be nature perfectly that be pron1 each of pron1 be here for   people be afraid of pron1 nowadays   pron1 have forget the high of all duty the duty pron1 pron1 owe to pron1 be self   of course pron1 be charitable   pron1 feed the hungry and clothe the beggar   but pron1 own soul starve and be naked   courage have go out of pron1 race   perhaps pron1 never really have pron1   the terror of society which be the basis of moral the terror of person1 which be the secret of religion these be the ordinal1 thing pron1 govern pron1   and yet 

  just turn pron1 head a little more to the right dorian like a good boy say the painter deep in pron1 work and conscious only that a look have come into the lad be face that pron1 have never see there before 

  and yet continue person1 person1 in pron1 low musical voice and with that graceful wave of the hand pron1 be always so characteristic of pron1 and that pron1 have even in pron1 person1 day pron1 believe that if ordinal1 man be to live out pron1 life fully and completely be to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dream pron1 believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy pron1 pron1 would forget all the malady of mediævalism and return to the hellenic ideal to pron1 fine rich than the hellenic ideal pron1 may be   but the brave man amongst pron1 be afraid of pron1   the mutilation of the savage have pron1 tragic survival in the self denial that person1 pron1 life   pron1 be punish for pron1 refusal   every impulse that pron1 strive to strangle brood in the mind and poison pron1   the body sin once and have do with pron1 sin for action be a mode of purification   pron1 remain then but the recollection of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret   the only way to get rid of a temptation be to yield to pron1   resist pron1 and pron1 soul grow sick with longing for the thing pron1 have forbid to pron1 with desire for pron1 pron1 monstrous law have make monstrous and unlawful   pron1 have be say that the great event of the world take place in the brain   pron1 be in the brain and the brain only that the great sin of the world take place also   pron1 person1   person1 pron1 pron1 with pron1 rose red youth and pron1 rose person1 person1 pron1 have have passion pron1 have make pron1 afraid thought pron1 have fill pron1 with terror day dream and sleep dream whose mere memory might stain pron1 cheek with shame 

  stop   person1 dorian gray stop   pron1 bewilder pron1   pron1 do not know pron1 to say   pron1 be some answer to pron1 but pron1 can not find pron1   do not speak   let pron1 think   or rather let pron1 try not to think   

for nearly ordinal1 minute pron1 stand there motionless with parted lip and eye strangely bright   pron1 be dimly conscious that entirely fresh influence be at work within pron1   yet pron1 seem to pron1 to have come really from pron1   the few word pron1 basil be friend have say to pron1 word speak by chance no doubt and with wilful paradox in pron1 have touch some secret chord pron1 have never be touch before but that pron1 feel be now vibrate and throbbing to curious pulse 

music have stir pron1 like that   person1 have trouble pron1 many time   but music be not articulate   pron1 be not a new world but rather another chaos that pron1 create in pron1   word   person1 word   how terrible pron1 be   how clear and vivid and cruel   pron1 could not escape from pron1   and yet pron1 a subtle magic pron1 be in pron1   pron1 seem to be able to give a plastic form to formless thing and to have a music of pron1 own as sweet as that of viol or of lute   person1 word   be pron1 pron1 so real as word 

yes   pron1 have be thing in pron1 boyhood that pron1 have not understand   pron1 understand pron1 now   person1 suddenly become fiery coloured to pron1   pron1 seem to pron1 that pron1 have be walk in fire   why have pron1 not know pron1 

with pron1 subtle smile person1 person1 watch pron1   pron1 know the precise psychological moment when to say pron1   pron1 feel intensely interested   pron1 be amazed at the sudden impression that pron1 word have produce and remember a book pron1 pron1 have read when pron1 be ordinal1 a book which have reveal to pron1 much that pron1 have not know before pron1 wonder whether dorian gray be pass through a similar experience   pron1 have merely shoot an arrow into the air   have pron1 hit the mark   how fascinating the lad be 

person1 paint away with that marvellous bold touch of pron1 pron1 have the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art at any rate come only from strength   pron1 be unconscious of the silence 

  basil pron1 be tired of stand cry dorian gray suddenly   pron1 must go out and sit in the garden   the air be stifle here   

  pron1 dear fellow pron1 be so sorry   when pron1 be paint pron1 can not think of pron1 else   but pron1 never sit well   pron1 be perfectly still   and pron1 have catch the effect pron1 want the half part lip and the bright look in the eye   pron1 do not know pron1 person1 have be say to pron1 but pron1 have certainly make pron1 have the most wonderful expression   pron1 suppose pron1 have be pay pron1 compliment   pron1 must not believe a word that pron1 say   

  pron1 have certainly not be pay pron1 compliment   perhaps that be the reason pron1 pron1 do not believe pron1 pron1 have tell pron1   

  pron1 know pron1 believe pron1 all say person1 person1 look at pron1 with pron1 dreamy languorous eye   pron1 will go out to the garden with pron1   pron1 be horribly hot in the studio   person1 let pron1 have pron1 ice to drink pron1 with strawberry in pron1   

  certainly person1   just touch the bell and when parker come pron1 will tell pron1 pron1 pron1 want   pron1 have get to work up this background so pron1 will join pron1 later on   do not keep dorian too long   pron1 have never be in well form for painting than pron1 be to day   this be go to be pron1 masterpiece   pron1 be pron1 masterpiece as pron1 stand   

person1 person1 go out to the garden and find dorian gray bury pron1 face in the great cool lilac blossom feverishly drink in pron1 perfume as if pron1 have be wine   pron1 come close to pron1 and put pron1 hand upon pron1 shoulder   pron1 be quite right to do that pron1 murmur   pron1 can cure the soul but the sense just as pron1 can cure the sense but the soul   

the lad start and draw back   pron1 be bareheade and the leave have toss pron1 rebellious curl and tangle all pron1 gilded thread   pron1 be a look of fear in pron1 eye such as people have when pron1 be suddenly awaken   pron1 finely chisel nostril quiver and some hide nerve shake the scarlet of pron1 lip and leave pron1 tremble 

  yes continue person1 person1 pron1 be ordinal1 of the great secret of life to cure the soul by mean of the sense and the sense by mean of the soul   pron1 be a wonderful creation   pron1 know more than pron1 think pron1 know just as pron1 know less than pron1 want to know   

dorian gray frown and turn pron1 head away   pron1 could not help like the tall graceful young man pron1 be stand by pron1   pron1 romantic olive coloured face and wear expression interest pron1   pron1 be pron1 in pron1 low languid voice pron1 be absolutely fascinating   pron1 cool white flowerlike hand even have a curious charm   pron1 move as pron1 speak like music and seem to have a language of pron1 own   but pron1 feel afraid of pron1 and ashamed of be afraid   why have pron1 be leave for a stranger to reveal pron1 to pron1   pron1 have know basil hallward for month but the friendship between pron1 have never alter pron1   suddenly pron1 have come some one across pron1 life pron1 seem to have disclose to pron1 life be mystery   and yet pron1 be there to be afraid of   pron1 be not a schoolboy or a girl   pron1 be absurd to be frightened 

  let pron1 go and sit in the shade say person1 person1   person1 have bring out the drink and if pron1 stay any long in this glare pron1 will be quite spoiled and basil will never paint pron1 again   pron1 really must not allow pron1 to become sunburnt   pron1 would be unbecoming   

  pron1 can pron1 matter   cry dorian gray laugh as pron1 sit down on the seat at the end of the garden 

  pron1 should matter pron1 to pron1 person1   person1   

  why   

  because pron1 have the most marvellous youth and youth be the ordinal1 thing worth have   

  pron1 do not feel that person1 person1   

  no pron1 do not feel pron1 now   some day when pron1 be old and wrinkled and ugly when thought have sear pron1 forehead with pron1 line and passion brand pron1 lip with pron1 hideous fire pron1 will feel pron1 pron1 will feel pron1 terribly   now wherever pron1 go pron1 charm the world   will pron1 always be so          pron1 have a wonderfully beautiful face person1   person1   do not frown   pron1 have   and beauty be a form of genius be high indeed than genius as pron1 need no explanation   pron1 be of the great fact of the world like sunlight or spring time or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell pron1 call the moon   pron1 can not be question   pron1 have pron1 divine right of sovereignty   pron1 make prince of those pron1 have pron1   pron1 smile   ah   when pron1 have lose pron1 pron1 will not smile         people say sometimes that beauty be only superficial   that may be so but at least pron1 be not so superficial as thought be   to pron1 beauty be the wonder of wonder   pron1 be only shallow people pron1 do not judge by appearance   the true mystery of the world be the visible not the invisible         yes person1   person1 the god have be good to pron1   but pron1 the god give pron1 quickly take away   pron1 have only a few year in which to live really perfectly and fully   when pron1 youth go pron1 beauty will go with pron1 and then pron1 will suddenly discover that pron1 be no triumph leave for pron1 or have to content pron1 with those mean triumph that the memory of pron1 past will make more bitter than defeat   every month as pron1 wane bring pron1 near to pron1 dreadful   person1 be jealous of pron1 and war against pron1 lily and pron1 rose   pron1 will become sallow and hollow cheeked and dull eyed   pron1 will suffer horribly         ah   realize pron1 youth while pron1 have pron1   do not squander the gold of pron1 day listen to the tedious try to improve the hopeless failure or give away pron1 life to the ignorant the common and the vulgar   these be the sickly aim the false ideal of pron1 age   live   live the wonderful life pron1 be in pron1   let pron1 be lose upon pron1   be always search for new sensation   be afraid of pron1         a new hedonism pron1 be pron1 pron1 century want   pron1 might be pron1 visible symbol   with pron1 personality pron1 be pron1 pron1 could not do   the world belong to pron1 for a season         the moment pron1 meet pron1 pron1 see that pron1 be quite unconscious of pron1 pron1 really be of pron1 pron1 really might be   pron1 be so much in pron1 pron1 charm pron1 that pron1 feel pron1 must tell pron1 pron1 about pron1   pron1 think how tragic pron1 would be if pron1 be waste   for pron1 be such a little time pron1 pron1 youth will last such a little time   the common hill flower wither but pron1 blossom again   the laburnum will be as yellow next person1 as pron1 be now   in a month pron1 will be purple star on the clematis and year after year the green night of pron1 leave will hold pron1 purple star   but pron1 never get back pron1 youth   the pulse of joy pron1 beat in pron1 at ordinal1 become sluggish   pron1 limb fail pron1 sense rot   pron1 degenerate into hideous puppet haunt by the memory of the passion of which pron1 be too much afraid and the exquisite temptation pron1 pron1 have not the courage to yield to   person1   person1   pron1 be absolutely pron1 in the world but youth   

dorian gray listen open eyed and wonder   the spray of person1 fall from pron1 hand upon the gravel   a furry bee come and buzz round pron1 for a moment   then pron1 begin to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossom   pron1 watch pron1 with that strange interest in trivial thing pron1 pron1 try to develop when thing of high import make pron1 afraid or when pron1 be stir by some new emotion for which pron1 can not find expression or when some think pron1 terrify pron1 lay sudden siege to the brain and call on pron1 to yield   after a time the bee fly away   pron1 see pron1 creep into the stain trumpet of a tyrian convolvulus   the flower seem to quiver and then sway gently to and fro 

suddenly the painter appear at the door of the studio and make staccato sign for pron1 to come in   pron1 turn to each other and smile 

  pron1 be wait pron1 cry   do come in   the light be quite perfect and pron1 can bring pron1 drink   

pron1 rise up and saunter down the walk together   ordinal1 green and white butterfly flutter past pron1 and in the pear tree at the corner of the garden a thrush begin to sing 

  pron1 be glad pron1 have meet pron1 person1   person1 say person1 person1 look at pron1 

  yes pron1 be glad now   pron1 wonder shall pron1 always be glad   

  always   that be a dreadful word   pron1 make pron1 shudder when pron1 hear pron1   woman be so fond of use pron1   pron1 spoil every romance by try to make pron1 last for ever   pron1 be a meaningless word too   the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion be that the caprice last a little long   

as pron1 enter the studio dorian gray put pron1 hand upon person1 person1 be arm   in that case let pron1 friendship be a caprice pron1 murmur flush at pron1 own boldness then step up on the platform and resume pron1 pose 

person1 person1 fling pron1 into a large wicker arm chair and watch pron1   the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas make the only sound pron1 break the stillness except when now and then person1 step back to look at pron1 work from a distance   in the slant beam pron1 stream through the open doorway the dust dance and be golden   the heavy scent of the rose seem to brood over pron1 

after about a quarter of an hour hallward stop painting look for a long time at dorian gray and then for a long time at the picture bite the end of ordinal1 of pron1 huge brush and frowning   pron1 be quite finish pron1 cry at last and stoop down pron1 write pron1 name in long vermilion letter on the left hand corner of the canvas 

person1 person1 come over and examine the picture   pron1 be certainly a wonderful work of art and a wonderful likeness as well 

  pron1 dear fellow pron1 congratulate pron1 most warmly pron1 say   pron1 be the fine portrait of modern time   person1   person1 come over and look at pron1   

the lad start as if awaken from some dream 

  be pron1 really finish   pron1 murmur step down from the platform 

  quite finish say the painter   and pron1 have sit splendidly to day   pron1 be awfully oblige to pron1   

  pron1 be entirely due to pron1 break in person1 person1   be not pron1 person1   person1   

person1 make no answer but pass listlessly in front of pron1 picture and turn towards pron1   when pron1 see pron1 pron1 draw back and pron1 cheek flush for a moment with pleasure   a look of joy come into pron1 eye as if pron1 have recognize pron1 for the first time   pron1 stand there motionless and in wonder dimly conscious that hallward be speak to pron1 but not catch the meaning of pron1 word   the sense of pron1 own beauty come on pron1 like a revelation   pron1 have never feel pron1 before   person1 hallward be compliment have seem to pron1 to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship   pron1 have listen to pron1 laugh at pron1 forget pron1   pron1 have not influence pron1 nature   then have come person1 person1 person1 with pron1 strange panegyric on youth pron1 terrible warning of pron1 brevity   that have stir pron1 at the time and now as pron1 stand gaze at the shadow of pron1 own loveliness the full reality of the description flash across pron1   yes pron1 would be a day when pron1 face would be wrinkle and wizen pron1 eye dim and colourless the grace of pron1 figure break and deformed   the scarlet would pass away from pron1 lip and the gold steal from pron1 hair   the life pron1 be to make pron1 soul would mar pron1 body   pron1 would become dreadful hideous and uncouth 

as pron1 think of pron1 a sharp pang of pain strike through pron1 like a knife and make each delicate fibre of pron1 nature quiver   pron1 eye deepen into amethyst and across pron1 come a mist of tear   pron1 feel as if a hand of ice have be lay upon pron1 heart 

  do not pron1 like pron1   cry hallward at last sting a little by the lad be silence not understand pron1 pron1 mean 

  of course pron1 like pron1 say person1 person1   pron1 would not like pron1   pron1 be ordinal1 of the great thing in modern art   pron1 will give pron1 pron1 pron1 like to ask for pron1   pron1 must have pron1   

  pron1 be not pron1 property person1   

  whose property be pron1   

  dorian be of course answer the painter 

  pron1 be a very lucky fellow   

  how sad pron1 be   murmured dorian gray with pron1 eye still fix upon pron1 own portrait   how sad pron1 be   pron1 shall grow old and horrible and dreadful   but this picture will remain always young   pron1 will never be old than this particular day of person1         if pron1 be only the other way   if pron1 be pron1 pron1 be to be always young and the picture pron1 be to grow old   for that for that pron1 would give pron1   yes pron1 be pron1 in the whole world pron1 would not give   pron1 would give pron1 soul for that   

  pron1 would hardly care for such an arrangement basil cry person1 person1 laugh   pron1 would be rather hard line on pron1 work   

  pron1 should object very strongly person1 say person1 

dorian gray turn and look at pron1   pron1 believe pron1 would basil   pron1 like pron1 art well than pron1 friend   pron1 be no more to pron1 than a green bronze figure   hardly as much pron1 dare say   

the painter stare in amazement   pron1 be so unlike dorian to speak like that   pron1 have happen   pron1 seem quite angry   pron1 face be flush and pron1 cheek burn 

  yes pron1 continue pron1 be less to pron1 than pron1 ivory person1 or pron1 silver faun   pron1 will like pron1 always   how long will pron1 like pron1   till pron1 have pron1 first wrinkle pron1 suppose   pron1 know now that when pron1 lose ordinal1 be good look whatever pron1 may be ordinal1 lose pron1   pron1 picture have teach pron1 that   person1 person1 person1 be perfectly right   person1 be the only thing worth have   when pron1 find that pron1 be grow old pron1 shall kill pron1   

person1 turn pale and catch pron1 hand   person1   person1   pron1 cry do not talk like that   pron1 have never have such a friend as pron1 and pron1 shall never have such another   pron1 be not jealous of material thing be pron1   pron1 pron1 be fine than any of pron1   

  pron1 be jealous of pron1 whose beauty do not die   pron1 be jealous of the portrait pron1 have paint of pron1   why should pron1 keep pron1 pron1 must lose   every moment pron1 pass take pron1 from pron1 and give pron1 to pron1   oh if pron1 be only the other way   if the picture could change and pron1 could be always pron1 pron1 be now   why do pron1 paint pron1   pron1 will mock pron1 some day mock pron1 horribly   the hot tear well into pron1 eye   pron1 tear pron1 hand away and fling pron1 on the divan pron1 bury pron1 face in the cushion as though pron1 be pray 

  this be pron1 do person1 say the painter bitterly 

person1 person1 shrug pron1 shoulder   pron1 be the real dorian gray pron1 be all   

  pron1 be not   

  if pron1 be not pron1 have pron1 to do with pron1   

  pron1 should have go away when pron1 ask pron1 pron1 mutter 

  pron1 stay when pron1 ask pron1 be person1 person1 be answer 

  person1 pron1 can not quarrel with pron1 ordinal1 good friend at once but between pron1 both pron1 have make pron1 hate the fine piece of work pron1 have ever do and pron1 will destroy pron1   pron1 be pron1 but canvas and colour   pron1 will not let pron1 come across pron1 ordinal1 life and mar pron1   

dorian gray lift pron1 golden head from the pillow and with pallid face and tear stain eye look at pron1 as pron1 walk over to the deal painting table pron1 be set beneath the high curtain window   pron1 be pron1 do there   pron1 finger be stray about among the litter of tin tube and dry brush seek for pron1   yes pron1 be for the long palette knife with pron1 thin blade of lithe steel   pron1 have find pron1 at last   pron1 be go to rip up the canvas 

with a stifle sob the lad leap from the couch and rush over to hallward tear the knife out of pron1 hand and fling pron1 to the end of the studio   do not basil do not   pron1 cry   pron1 would be murder   

  pron1 be glad pron1 appreciate pron1 work at last person1 say the painter coldly when pron1 have recover from pron1 surprise   pron1 never think pron1 would

  well as soon as pron1 be dry pron1 shall be varnish and frame and send home   then pron1 can do pron1 pron1 like with pron1   and pron1 walk across the room and ring the bell for tea   pron1 will have tea of course dorian   and so will pron1 person1   or do pron1 object to such simple pleasure   

  pron1 adore simple pleasure say person1 person1   pron1 be the last refuge of the complex   but pron1 do not like scene except on the stage   pron1 absurd fellow pron1 be both of pron1   pron1 wonder pron1 pron1 be define man as a rational animal   pron1 be the most premature definition ever give   person1 be many thing but pron1 be not rational   pron1 be glad pron1 be not after all though pron1 wish pron1 chap would not squabble over the picture   pron1 have much well let pron1 have pron1 basil   this silly boy do not really want pron1 and pron1 really do   

  if pron1 let any one have pron1 but pron1 basil pron1 shall never forgive pron1   cry dorian gray   and pron1 do not allow people to call pron1 a silly boy

  yes answer person1 person1 person1 the costume of the nineteenth century be detestable   pron1 be so sombre so depressing   sin be the only real colour element leave in modern life

  this play be good enough for pron1 person1   pron1 be person1 and person1   pron1 must admit that pron1 be rather annoyed at the idea of see shakespeare do in such a wretched hole of a place   still pron1 feel interested in a sort of way   at any rate pron1 determine to wait for the first act   pron1 be a dreadful orchestra preside over by a young hebrew pron1 sit at a crack piano pron1 nearly drive pron1 away but at last the drop scene be draw up and the play begin   person1 be a stout elderly gentleman with cork eyebrow a husky tragedy voice and a figure like a beer barrel   person1 be almost as bad   pron1 be play by the low comedian pron1 have introduce gag of pron1 own and be on most friendly term with the pit   pron1 be both as grotesque as the scenery and that look as if pron1 have come out of a country booth   but person1   person1 imagine a girl hardly ordinal1 year of age with a little flowerlike face a small greek head with plait coil of dark brown hair eye pron1 be violet well of passion lip pron1 be like the petal of a rose   pron1 be the lovely thing pron1 have ever see in pron1 life   pron1 say to pron1 once that pathos leave pron1 unmoved but that beauty mere beauty could fill pron1 eye with tear   pron1 tell pron1 person1 pron1 could hardly see this girl for the mist of tear pron1 come across pron1   and pron1 voice pron1 never hear such a voice   pron1 be very low at first with deep mellow note pron1 seem to fall singly upon ordinal1 be ear   then pron1 become a little louder and sound like a flute or a distant hautboy   in the garden scene pron1 have all the tremulous ecstasy that pron1 hear just before dawn when nightingale be singe   pron1 be moment later on when pron1 have the wild passion of violin   pron1 know how a voice can stir ordinal1   pron1 voice and the voice of person1 person1 be ordinal1 thing pron1 pron1 shall never forget   when pron1 close pron1 eye pron1 hear pron1 and each of pron1 say pron1 different   pron1 do not know which to follow   why should pron1 not love pron1   person1 pron1 do love pron1   pron1 be pron1 to pron1 in life   person1 after night pron1 go to see pron1 play   ordinal1 evening pron1 be rosalind and the next evening pron1 be person1   pron1 have see pron1 die in the gloom of an italian tomb suck the poison from pron1 lover be lip   pron1 have watch pron1 wander through the forest of person1 disguise as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap   pron1 have be mad and have come into the presence of a guilty king and give pron1 rue to wear and bitter herb to taste of   pron1 have be innocent and the black hand of jealousy have crush pron1 reedlike throat   pron1 have see pron1 in every age and in every costume   ordinary woman never appeal to ordinal1 be imagination   pron1 be limited to pron1 century   no glamour ever transfigure pron1   ordinal1 know pron1 mind as easily as pron1 know pron1 bonnet   pron1 can always find pron1   pron1 be no mystery in any of pron1   pron1 ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea party in the afternoon   pron1 have pron1 stereotyped smile and pron1 fashionable manner   pron1 be quite obvious   but an actress   how different an actress be   person1   why do not pron1 tell pron1 that the only thing worth love be an actress   

  because pron1 have love so many of pron1 dorian   

  oh yes horrid people with dye hair and paint face   

  do not run down dye hair and paint face   pron1 be an extraordinary charm in pron1 sometimes say person1 person1 

  pron1 wish now pron1 have not tell pron1 about person1 person1   

  pron1 could not have help tell pron1 dorian   all through pron1 life pron1 will tell pron1 pron1 pron1 do   

  yes person1 pron1 believe that be true   pron1 can not help tell pron1 thing   pron1 have a curious influence over pron1   if pron1 ever do a crime pron1 would come and confess pron1 to pron1   pron1 would understand pron1   

  people like pron1 the wilful sunbeam of life do not commit crime dorian   but pron1 be much oblige for the compliment all the same   and now tell pron1 reach pron1 the match like a good boy thank pron1 be pron1 actual relation with person1 person1   

dorian gray leap to pron1 foot with flushed cheek and burn eye   person1   person1 vane be sacred   

  pron1 be only the sacred thing pron1 be worth touch person1 say person1 person1 with a strange touch of pathos in pron1 voice   but why should pron1 be annoy   pron1 suppose pron1 will belong to pron1 some day   when pron1 be in love pron1 always begin by deceive ordinal1 be self and pron1 always end by deceive other   that be pron1 the world call a romance   pron1 know pron1 at any rate pron1 suppose   

  of course pron1 know pron1   on the first night pron1 be at the theatre the horrid old person1 come round to the box after the performance be over and offer to take pron1 behind the scene and introduce pron1 to pron1   pron1 be furious with pron1 and tell pron1 that person1 have be dead for hundred of year and that pron1 body be lie in a marble tomb in person1   pron1 think from pron1 blank look of amazement that pron1 be under the impression that pron1 have take too much champagne or pron1   

  pron1 be not surprised   

  then pron1 ask pron1 if pron1 write for any of the newspaper   pron1 tell pron1 pron1 never even read pron1   pron1 seem terribly disappointed at that and confide to pron1 that all the dramatic critic be in a conspiracy against pron1 and that pron1 be every ordinal1 of pron1 to be buy   

  pron1 should not wonder if pron1 be quite right there   but on the other hand judge from pron1 appearance most of pron1 can not be at all expensive   

  well pron1 seem to think pron1 be beyond pron1 mean laugh dorian   by this time however the light be be put out in the theatre and pron1 have to go   pron1 want pron1 to try some cigar pron1 pron1 strongly recommend   pron1 decline   the next night of course pron1 arrive at the place again   when pron1 see pron1 pron1 make pron1 a low bow and assure pron1 that pron1 be a munificent patron of art   pron1 be a most offensive brute though pron1 have an extraordinary passion for shakespeare   pron1 tell pron1 once with an air of pride that pron1 ordinal1 bankruptcy be entirely due to the person1 as pron1 insist on call pron1   pron1 seem to think pron1 a distinction   

  pron1 be a distinction pron1 dear dorian a great distinction   most people become bankrupt through have invest too heavily in the prose of life   to have ruin ordinal1 be self over poetry be an honour   but when do pron1 first speak to miss person1 vane   

  the third night   pron1 have be play rosalind   pron1 could not help go round   pron1 have throw pron1 some flower and pron1 have look at pron1 at least pron1 fancy that pron1 have   the old person1 be persistent   pron1 seem determined to take pron1 behind so pron1 consent   pron1 be curious pron1 not want to know pron1 be not pron1   

  no   pron1 do not think so   

  pron1 person1 person1 why   

  pron1 will tell pron1 some other time   now pron1 want to know about the girl   

  sibyl   oh pron1 be so shy and so gentle   pron1 be pron1 of a child about pron1   pron1 eye open wide in exquisite wonder when pron1 tell pron1 pron1 pron1 think of pron1 performance and pron1 seem quite unconscious of pron1 power   pron1 think pron1 be both rather nervous   the old person1 stand grin at the doorway of the dusty greenroom make elaborate speech about pron1 both while pron1 stand look at each other like child   pron1 would insist on call pron1 pron1 person1 so pron1 have to assure sibyl that pron1 be not pron1 of the kind   pron1 say quite simply to pron1 pron1 look more like a prince   pron1 must call pron1 prince charming   

  upon pron1 word dorian miss person1 know how to pay compliment   

  pron1 do not understand pron1 person1   pron1 regard pron1 merely as a person in a play   pron1 know pron1 of life   pron1 live with pron1 mother a fade tired woman pron1 play lady capulet in a sort of magenta dress wrapper on the first night and look as if pron1 have see well day   

  pron1 know that look   pron1 depress pron1 murmur person1 person1 examine pron1 ring 

  the person1 want to tell pron1 pron1 history but pron1 say pron1 do not interest pron1   

  pron1 be quite right   pron1 be always pron1 infinitely mean about other people be tragedy   

  sibyl be the only thing pron1 care about   pron1 be pron1 to pron1 where pron1 come from   from pron1 little head to pron1 little foot pron1 be absolutely and entirely divine   every night of pron1 life pron1 go to see pron1 act and every night pron1 be more marvellous   

  pron1 be the reason pron1 suppose that pron1 never dine with pron1 now   pron1 think pron1 must have some curious romance on hand   pron1 have   but pron1 be not quite pron1 pron1 expect   

  pron1 dear person1 pron1 either lunch or sup together every day and pron1 have be to the opera with pron1 several time say dorian open pron1 blue eye in wonder 

  pron1 always come dreadfully late   

  well pron1 can not help go to see sibyl play pron1 cry even if pron1 be only for a single act   pron1 get hungry for pron1 presence   and when pron1 think of the wonderful soul pron1 be hide away in that little ivory body pron1 be fill with awe   

  pron1 can dine with pron1 to night dorian can not pron1   

pron1 shake pron1 head   to night pron1 be person1 pron1 answer and to morrow night pron1 will be person1   

  when be pron1 sibyl vane   

  never   

  pron1 congratulate pron1   

  how horrid pron1 be   pron1 be all the great heroine of the world in ordinal1   pron1 be more than an individual   pron1 laugh but pron1 tell pron1 pron1 have genius   pron1 love pron1 and pron1 must make pron1 love pron1   pron1 pron1 know all the secret of life tell pron1 how to charm person1 vane to love pron1   pron1 want to make person1 jealous   pron1 want the dead lover of the world to hear pron1 laughter and grow sad   pron1 want a breath of pron1 passion to stir pron1 dust into consciousness to wake pron1 ashe into pain   pron1 person1 person1 how pron1 worship pron1   pron1 be walk up and down the room as pron1 speak   hectic spot of red burn on pron1 cheek   pron1 be terribly excited 

person1 person1 watch pron1 with a subtle sense of pleasure   how different pron1 be now from the shy frightened boy pron1 have meet in person1 person1 be studio   pron1 nature have develop like a flower have bear blossom of scarlet flame   out of pron1 secret hiding place have creep pron1 soul and desire have come to meet pron1 on the way 

  and pron1 do pron1 propose to do   person1 person1 person1 at last 

  pron1 want pron1 and basil to come with pron1 some night and see pron1 act   pron1 have not the slight fear of the result   pron1 be certain to acknowledge pron1 genius   then pron1 must get pron1 out of the person1 be hand   pron1 be bind to pron1 for ordinal1 year at least for ordinal1 year and ordinal1 month from the present time   pron1 shall have to pay pron1 pron1 of course   when all pron1 be settle pron1 shall take a west end theatre and bring pron1 out properly   pron1 will make the world as mad as pron1 have make pron1   

  pron1 would be impossible pron1 dear boy   

  yes pron1 will   pron1 have not merely art consummate art instinct in pron1 but pron1 have personality also   and pron1 have often tell pron1 that pron1 be personality not principle pron1 move the age   

  well what night shall pron1 go   

  let pron1 see   to day be person1   let pron1 fix to morrow   pron1 play person1 to morrow   

  all right   the person1 at ordinal1 o clock   and pron1 will get basil   

  not ordinal1 person1 please   half past ordinal1   pron1 must be there before the curtain rise   pron1 must see pron1 in the first act where pron1 meet person1   

  half past ordinal1   pron1 an hour   pron1 will be like have a meat tea or read an english novel   pron1 must be ordinal1   no gentleman dine before ordinal1   shall pron1 see basil between this and then   or shall pron1 write to pron1   

  dear basil   pron1 have not lay eye on pron1 for a week   pron1 be rather horrid of pron1 as pron1 have send pron1 pron1 portrait in the most wonderful frame specially design by pron1 and though pron1 be a little jealous of the picture for be a whole month young than pron1 be pron1 must admit that pron1 delight in pron1   perhaps pron1 have well write to pron1   pron1 do not want to see pron1 alone   pron1 say thing pron1 annoy pron1   pron1 give pron1 good advice   

person1 person1 smile   people be very fond of give away pron1 pron1 need most pron1   pron1 be pron1 pron1 call the depth of generosity   

  oh basil be the good of fellow but pron1 seem to pron1 to be just a bit of a philistine   since pron1 have know pron1 person1 pron1 have discover that   

  basil pron1 dear boy put pron1 pron1 be charming in pron1 into pron1 work   the consequence be that pron1 have pron1 leave for life but pron1 prejudice pron1 principle and pron1 common sense   the only artist pron1 have ever know pron1 be personally delightful be bad artist   good artist exist simply in pron1 pron1 make and consequently be perfectly uninteresting in pron1 pron1 be   a great poet a really great poet be the most unpoetical of all creature   but inferior poet be absolutely fascinating   the bad pron1 rhyme be the more picturesque pron1 look   the mere fact of have publish a book of second rate sonnet make a man quite irresistible   pron1 live the poetry that pron1 can not write   the other write the poetry that pron1 dare not realize   

  pron1 wonder be that really so person1   person1 dorian gray put some perfume on pron1 handkerchief out of a large gold top bottle pron1 stand on the table   pron1 must be if pron1 say pron1   and now pron1 be off   person1 be wait for pron1   do not forget about to morrow   good bye   

as pron1 leave the room person1 person1 be heavy eyelid droop and pron1 begin to think   certainly few people have ever interest pron1 so much as dorian gray and yet the lad be mad adoration of some one else cause pron1 not the slight pang of annoyance or jealousy   pron1 be pleased by pron1   pron1 make pron1 a more interesting study   pron1 have be always enthral by the method of natural science but the ordinary subject matter of that science have seem to pron1 trivial and of no import   and so pron1 have begin by vivisect pron1 as pron1 have end by vivisect other   human life pron1 appear to pron1 the ordinal1 thing worth investigate   compare to pron1 pron1 be pron1 else of any value   pron1 be true that as ordinal1 watch life in pron1 curious crucible of pain and pleasure pron1 could not wear over pron1 be face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fume from trouble the brain and make the imagination turbid with monstrous fancy and misshapen dream   pron1 be poison so subtle that to know pron1 property ordinal1 have to sicken of pron1   pron1 be malady so strange that pron1 have to pass through pron1 if pron1 seek to understand pron1 nature   and yet pron1 a great reward ordinal1 receive   how wonderful the whole world become to ordinal1   to note the curious hard logic of passion and the emotional coloured life of the intellect to observe where pron1 meet and where pron1 separate at what point pron1 be in unison and at what point pron1 be at discord pron1 be a delight in that   pron1 matter pron1 the cost be   pron1 could never pay too high a price for any sensation 

pron1 be conscious and the thought bring a gleam of pleasure into pron1 brown agate eye that pron1 be through certain word of pron1 musical word say with musical utterance pron1 dorian gray be soul have turn to this white girl and bow in worship before pron1   to a large extent the lad be pron1 own creation   pron1 have make pron1 premature   that be pron1   ordinary people wait till life disclose to pron1 pron1 secret but to the few to the elect the mystery of life be reveal before the veil be draw away   sometimes this be the effect of art and chiefly of the art of literature which deal immediately with the passion and the intellect   but now and then a complex personality take the place and assume the office of art be indeed in pron1 way a real work of art life have pron1 elaborate masterpiece just as poetry have or sculpture or painting 

yes the lad be premature   pron1 be gather pron1 harvest while pron1 be yet spring   the pulse and passion of youth be in pron1 but pron1 be become self conscious   pron1 be delightful to watch pron1   with pron1 beautiful face and pron1 beautiful soul pron1 be a thing to wonder at   pron1 be no matter how pron1 all end or be destine to end   pron1 be like ordinal1 of those gracious figure in a pageant or a play whose joy seem to be remote from ordinal1 but whose sorrow stir ordinal1 be sense of beauty and whose wound be like red rose 

soul and body body and soul how mysterious pron1 be   pron1 be animalism in the soul and the body have pron1 moment of spirituality   the sense could refine and the intellect could degrade   pron1 could say where the fleshly impulse cease or the psychical impulse begin   how shallow be the arbitrary definition of ordinary psychologist   and yet how difficult to decide between the claim of the various school   be the soul a shadow seat in the house of sin   or be the body really in the soul as person1 person1 think   the separation of spirit from matter be a mystery and the union of person1 with matter be a mystery also 

pron1 begin to wonder whether pron1 could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be reveal to pron1   as pron1 be pron1 always misunderstand pron1 and rarely understand other   experience be of no ethical value   pron1 be merely the name man give to pron1 mistake   person1 have as a rule regard pron1 as a mode of warning have claim for pron1 a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character have praise pron1 as pron1 pron1 teach pron1 pron1 to follow and show pron1 pron1 to avoid   but pron1 be no motive power in experience   pron1 be as little of an active cause as conscience pron1   all pron1 pron1 really demonstrate be that pron1 future would be the same as pron1 past and that the sin pron1 have do once and with loathing pron1 would do many time and with joy 

pron1 be clear to pron1 that the experimental method be the only method by which pron1 could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passion   and certainly dorian gray be a subject make to pron1 hand and seem to promise rich and fruitful result   pron1 sudden mad love for person1 person1 be a psychological phenomenon of no small interest   pron1 be no doubt that curiosity have much to do with pron1 curiosity and the desire for new experience yet pron1 be not a simple but rather a very complex passion   pron1 pron1 be in pron1 of the purely sensuous instinct of person1 have be transform by the working of the imagination change into pron1 pron1 seem to the lad pron1 to be remote from sense and be for that very reason all the more dangerous   pron1 be the passion about whose origin pron1 deceive pron1 pron1 tyrannize most strongly over pron1   pron1 weak motive be those of whose nature pron1 be conscious   pron1 often happen that when pron1 think pron1 be experiment on other pron1 be really experiment on pron1 

while person1 person1 sit dream on these thing a knock come to the door and pron1 valet enter and remind pron1 pron1 be time to dress for dinner   pron1 get up and look out into the street   the sunset have smite into scarlet gold the upper window of the house opposite   the pane glow like plate of heated metal   the sky above be like a fade rose   pron1 think of pron1 friend be young fiery coloured life and wonder how pron1 be all go to end 

when pron1 arrive home about half past ordinal1 o clock pron1 see a telegram lie on the hall table   pron1 open pron1 and find pron1 be from dorian gray   pron1 be to tell pron1 that pron1 be engage to be married to sibyl vane

the eld woman grow pale beneath the coarse powder pron1 daub pron1 cheek and pron1 dry lip twitch with a spasm of pain   person1 rush to pron1 flung pron1 arm round pron1 neck and kiss pron1   forgive pron1 mother   pron1 know pron1 pain pron1 to talk about pron1 father   but pron1 only pain pron1 because pron1 love pron1 so much   do not look so sad   pron1 be as happy to day as pron1 be ordinal1 year ago   ah   let pron1 be happy for ever

chapter vi 
  pron1 suppose pron1 have hear the news basil   person1 person1 person1 that evening as person1 be show into a little private room at the person1 where dinner have be lay for ordinal1 

  no person1 answer the artist give pron1 hat and coat to the bow waiter   pron1 be pron1   pron1 about politic pron1 hope   pron1 do not interest pron1   pron1 be hardly a single person in the house of common worth paint though many of pron1 would be the well for a little whitewashing   

  dorian gray be engage to be marry say person1 person1 watch pron1 as pron1 speak 

person1 start and then frown   person1 engage to be marry   pron1 cry   impossible   

  pron1 be perfectly true   

  to pron1   

  to some little actress or other   

  pron1 can not believe pron1   person1 be far too sensible   

  dorian be far too wise not to do foolish thing now and then pron1 dear basil   

  marriage be hardly a thing pron1 pron1 can do now and then person1   

  except in person1 rejoin person1 person1 languidly   but pron1 do not say pron1 be marry   pron1 say pron1 be engage to be marry   pron1 be a great difference   pron1 have a distinct remembrance of be marry but pron1 have no recollection at all of be engage   pron1 be inclined to think that pron1 never be engage   

  but think of person1 be birth and position and wealth   pron1 would be absurd for pron1 to marry so much beneath pron1   

  if pron1 want to make pron1 marry this girl tell pron1 that basil   pron1 be sure to do pron1 then   whenever a man do a thoroughly stupid thing pron1 be always from the noble motive   

  pron1 hope the girl be good person1   pron1 do not want to see person1 tie to some vile creature pron1 might degrade pron1 nature and ruin pron1 intellect   

  oh pron1 be well than good pron1 be beautiful murmured person1 person1 sip a glass of vermouth and orange bitter   person1 say pron1 be beautiful and pron1 be not often wrong about thing of that kind   pron1 portrait of pron1 have quicken pron1 appreciation of the personal appearance of other people   pron1 have have that excellent effect amongst other   pron1 be to see pron1 to night if that boy do not forget pron1 appointment   

  be pron1 serious

  but do pron1 approve of pron1 person1   ask the painter walk up and down the room and bite pron1 lip   pron1 can not approve of pron1 possibly   pron1 be some silly infatuation   

  pron1 never approve or disapprove of pron1 now   pron1 be an absurd attitude to take towards life   pron1 be not send into the world to air pron1 moral prejudice   pron1 never take any notice of pron1 common people say and pron1 never interfere with pron1 charming people do   if a personality fascinate pron1 whatever mode of expression pron1 personality select be absolutely delightful to pron1   dorian gray fall in love with a beautiful girl pron1 act person1 and propose to marry pron1   why not   if pron1 wed messalina pron1 would be none the less interesting   pron1 know pron1 be not a champion of marriage   the real drawback to marriage be that pron1 make ordinal1 unselfish   and unselfish people be colourless   pron1 lack individuality   still pron1 be certain temperament that marriage make more complex   pron1 retain pron1 egotism and add to pron1 many other ego   pron1 be force to have more than ordinal1 life   pron1 become more highly organized and to be highly organized be pron1 should fancy the object of man be existence   besides every experience be of value and whatever pron1 may say against marriage pron1 be certainly an experience   pron1 hope that dorian gray will make this girl pron1 wife passionately adore pron1 for ordinal1 month and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else   pron1 would be a wonderful study   

  pron1 do not mean a single word of all pron1 person1   pron1 know pron1 do not   if dorian gray be life be spoil no one would be sorrier than pron1   pron1 be much well than pron1 pretend to be   

person1 person1 laugh   the reason pron1 all like to think so well of other be that pron1 be all afraid for pron1   the basis of optimism be sheer terror   pron1 think that pron1 be generous because pron1 credit pron1 neighbour with the possession of those virtue pron1 be likely to be a benefit to pron1   pron1 praise the banker pron1 pron1 may overdraw pron1 account and find good quality in the highwayman in the hope that pron1 may spare pron1 pocket   pron1 mean pron1 pron1 pron1 have say   pron1 have the great contempt for optimism   as for a spoiled life no life be spoiled but ordinal1 whose growth be arrest   if pron1 want to mar a nature pron1 have merely to reform pron1   as for marriage of course pron1 would be silly but pron1 be other and more interesting bond between man and woman   pron1 will certainly encourage pron1   pron1 have the charm of be fashionable   but here be dorian pron1   pron1 will tell pron1 more than pron1 can   

  pron1 dear person1 pron1 dear basil pron1 must both congratulate pron1   say the lad throw off pron1 evening cape with pron1 satin line wing and shake each of pron1 friend by the hand in turn   pron1 have never be so happy   of course pron1 be sudden all really delightful thing be   and yet pron1 seem to pron1 to be the ordinal1 thing pron1 have be look for all pron1 life   pron1 be flush with excitement and pleasure and look extraordinarily handsome 

  pron1 hope pron1 will always be very happy dorian say hallward but pron1 do not quite forgive pron1 for not have let pron1 know of pron1 engagement   pron1 let person1 know

person1 person1 sip pron1 champagne in a meditative manner   at pron1 particular point do pron1 mention the word marriage dorian   and pron1 do pron1 say in answer   perhaps pron1 forgot all about pron1   

  pron1 person1 person1 pron1 do not treat pron1 as a business transaction and pron1 do not make any formal proposal   pron1 tell pron1 that pron1 love pron1 and pron1 say pron1 be not worthy to be pron1 wife   not worthy   why the whole world be pron1 to pron1 compare with pron1   

  woman be wonderfully practical murmured person1 person1 much more practical than pron1 be   in situation of that kind pron1 often forget to say pron1 about marriage and pron1 always remind pron1

pron1 weep silently and make no answer but creep near   pron1 little hand stretch blindly out and appear to be seek for pron1   pron1 turn on pron1 heel and leave the room   in a few moment pron1 be out of the theatre 

where pron1 go to pron1 hardly know   pron1 remember wander through dimly light street past gaunt black shadow archway and evil look house   woman with hoarse voice and harsh laughter have call after pron1   person1 have reel by curse and chatter to pron1 like monstrous ape   pron1 have see grotesque child huddle upon door step and hear shriek and oath from gloomy court 

as the dawn be just break pron1 find pron1 close to covent garden   the darkness lift and flush with faint fire the sky hollow pron1 into a perfect pearl   huge cart fill with nod lily rumble slowly down the polished empty street   the air be heavy with the perfume of the flower and pron1 beauty seem to bring pron1 an anodyne for pron1 pain   pron1 follow into the market and watch the man unload pron1 waggon   a white smocked person1 offer pron1 some cherry   pron1 thank pron1 wonder why pron1 refuse to accept any money for pron1 and begin to eat pron1 listlessly   pron1 have be pluck at midnight and the coldness of the moon have enter into pron1   a long line of boy carry crate of stripe tulip and of yellow and red rose defile in front of pron1 thread pron1 way through the huge jade green pile of vegetable   under the portico with pron1 grey sun bleach pillar loiter a troop of draggle bareheaded girl wait for the auction to be over   other crowd round the swinge door of the coffee house in the piazza   the heavy cart horse slip and stamp upon the rough stone shake pron1 bell and trapping   some of the driver be lie asleep on a pile of sack   person1 neck and pink foot the pigeon run about pick up seed 

after a little while pron1 hail a hansom and drive home   for a few moment pron1 loiter upon the doorstep look round at the silent square with pron1 blank close shuttered window and pron1 stare blind   the sky be pure opal now and the roof of the house glisten like silver against pron1   from some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke be rise   pron1 curl a violet riband through the nacre coloured air

pron1 throw pron1 into a chair and begin to think   suddenly pron1 flash across pron1 mind pron1 pron1 have say in person1 person1 be studio the day the picture have be finish   yes pron1 remember pron1 perfectly   pron1 have utter a mad wish that pron1 pron1 might remain young and the portrait grow old   that pron1 own beauty might be untarnished and the face on the canvas bear the burden of pron1 passion and pron1 sin   that the paint image might be sear with the line of suffering and think and that pron1 might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of pron1 then just conscious boyhood   surely pron1 wish have not be fulfil   such thing be impossible   pron1 seem monstrous even to think of pron1   and yet pron1 be the picture before pron1 with the touch of cruelty in the mouth

yet pron1 be watch pron1 with pron1 beautiful marred face and pron1 cruel smile   pron1 bright hair gleam in the early sunlight   pron1 blue eye meet pron1 own   a sense of infinite pity not for pron1 but for the paint image of pron1 come over pron1   pron1 have alter already and would alter more   pron1 gold would wither into person1   pron1 red and white rose would die   for every sin pron1 pron1 commit a stain would person1 and wreck pron1 fairness   but pron1 would not sin   the picture change or unchanged would be to pron1 the visible emblem of conscience   pron1 would resist temptation   pron1 would not see person1 person1 any more would not at any rate listen to those subtle poisonous theory that in person1 person1 be garden have first stir within pron1 the passion for impossible thing   pron1 would go back to person1 vane make pron1 amend marry pron1 try to love pron1 again   yes pron1 be pron1 duty to do so   pron1 must have suffer more than pron1 have   poor child   pron1 have be selfish and cruel to pron1   the fascination pron1 pron1 have exercise over pron1 would return   pron1 would be happy together   pron1 life with pron1 would be beautiful and pure 

pron1 get up from pron1 chair and draw a large screen right in front of the portrait shudder as pron1 glance at pron1   how horrible   pron1 murmur to pron1 and pron1 walk across to the window and open pron1   when pron1 step out on to the grass pron1 draw a deep breath   the fresh morning air seem to drive away all pron1 sombre passion   pron1 think only of sibyl   a faint echo of pron1 love come back to pron1   pron1 repeat pron1 name over and over again   the bird pron1 be singe in the dew drench garden seem to be tell the flower about pron1 

chapter viii 
pron1 be long past noon when pron1 awake   pron1 valet have creep several time on tiptoe into the room to see if pron1 be stir and have wonder pron1 make pron1 young master sleep so late   finally pron1 bell sound and victor come in softly with a cup of tea and a pile of letter on a small tray of old sevres person1 and draw back the olive satin curtain with pron1 shimmer blue lining pron1 hang in front of the ordinal1 tall window 

  person1 have well sleep this morning pron1 say smile 

  what o clock be pron1 victor   ask dorian gray drowsily 

  ordinal1 hour and a quarter monsieur   

how late pron1 be   pron1 sit up and have sip some tea turn over pron1 letter   ordinal1 of pron1 be from person1 person1 and have be bring by hand that morning   pron1 hesitate for a moment and then put pron1 aside   the other pron1 open listlessly   pron1 contain the usual collection of card invitation to dinner ticket for private view programme of charity concert and the like that be shower on fashionable young man every morning during the season   pron1 be a rather heavy bill for a chase person1 person1 person1 person1 set that pron1 have not yet have the courage to send on to pron1 guardian pron1 be extremely old fashioned people and do not realize that pron1 live in an age when unnecessary thing be pron1 only necessity   and pron1 be several very courteously word communication from person1 person1 money lender offer to advance any sum of money at a moment be notice and at the most reasonable rate of interest 

after about ordinal1 minute pron1 get up and throw on an elaborate dressing gown of silk embroider cashmere wool pass into the person1 pave bathroom   the cool water refresh pron1 after pron1 long sleep   pron1 seem to have forget all pron1 pron1 have go through   a dim sense of have take part in some strange tragedy come to pron1 once or twice but pron1 be the unreality of a dream about pron1 

as soon as pron1 be dress pron1 go into the library and sit down to a light french breakfast pron1 have be lay out for pron1 on a small round table close to the open window   pron1 be an exquisite day   the warm air seem laden with spice   a bee fly in and buzz round the blue dragon bowl pron1 fill with sulphur yellow rose stand before pron1   pron1 feel perfectly happy 

suddenly pron1 eye fall on the screen pron1 pron1 have place in front of the portrait and pron1 start 

  too cold for person1   ask pron1 valet put an omelette on the table   pron1 shut the window   

person1 shake pron1 head   pron1 be not cold pron1 murmur 

be pron1 all true   have the portrait really change   or have pron1 be simply pron1 own imagination pron1 have make pron1 see a look of evil where pron1 have be a look of joy   surely a paint canvas could not alter   the thing be absurd   pron1 would serve as a tale to tell basil some day   pron1 would make pron1 smile 

and yet how vivid be pron1 recollection of the whole thing   first in the dim twilight and then in the bright dawn pron1 have see the touch of cruelty round the warped lip   pron1 almost dread pron1 valet leave the room   pron1 know that when pron1 be alone pron1 would have to examine the portrait   pron1 be afraid of certainty   when the coffee and cigarette have be bring and the man turn to go pron1 feel a wild desire to tell pron1 to remain   as the door be close behind pron1 pron1 call pron1 back   the man stand wait for pron1 order   person1 look at pron1 for a moment   pron1 be not at home to any ordinal1 victor pron1 say with a sigh   the man bow and retire 

then pron1 rise from the table light a cigarette and fling pron1 down on a luxuriously cushion couch pron1 stand face the screen   the screen be an old ordinal1 of gilt spanish leather stamp and work with a rather florid person1 person1 pattern   pron1 scan pron1 curiously wonder if ever before pron1 have conceal the secret of a man be life 

should pron1 move pron1 aside after all   why not let pron1 stay there   pron1 be the use of know   if the thing be true pron1 be terrible   if pron1 be not true why trouble about pron1   but pron1 if by some fate or deadly chance eye other than pron1 spy behind and see the horrible change   pron1 should pron1 do if person1 hallward come and ask to look at pron1 own picture   person1 would be sure to do that   no   the thing have to be examine and at once   pron1 would be well than this dreadful state of doubt 

pron1 get up and lock both door   at least pron1 would be alone when pron1 look upon the mask of pron1 shame   then pron1 draw the screen aside and see pron1 face to face   pron1 be perfectly true   the portrait have alter 

as pron1 often remember afterwards and always with no small wonder pron1 find pron1 at first gaze at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest   that such a change should have take place be incredible to pron1   and yet pron1 be a fact   be pron1 some subtle affinity between the chemical atom pron1 shape pron1 into form and colour on the canvas and the soul pron1 be within pron1   could pron1 be that pron1 that soul think pron1 realize   that pron1 pron1 dream pron1 make true   or be pron1 some other more terrible reason   pron1 shudder and feel afraid and go back to the couch lie there gaze at the picture in sickened horror 

ordinal1 thing however pron1 feel that pron1 have do for pron1   pron1 have make pron1 conscious how unjust how cruel pron1 have be to sibyl vane   pron1 be not too late to make reparation for that   pron1 could still be pron1 wife   pron1 unreal and selfish love would yield to some high influence would be transform into some noble passion and the portrait pron1 person1 person1 have paint of pron1 would be a guide to pron1 through life would be to pron1 what holiness be to some and conscience to other and the fear of person1 to pron1 all   pron1 be opiate for remorse drug pron1 could lull the moral sense to sleep   but here be a visible symbol of the degradation of sin   here be an ever present sign of the ruin man bring upon pron1 soul 

ordinal1 o clock strike and ordinal1 and the half hour ring pron1 double chime but dorian gray do not stir   pron1 be try to gather up the scarlet thread of life and to weave pron1 into a pattern   to find pron1 way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which pron1 be wander   pron1 do not know pron1 to do or pron1 to think   finally pron1 go over to the table and write a passionate letter to the girl pron1 have love implore pron1 forgiveness and accuse pron1 of madness   pron1 cover page after page with wild word of sorrow and wild word of pain   pron1 be a luxury in self reproach   when pron1 blame pron1 pron1 feel that no one else have a right to blame pron1   pron1 be the confession not the priest pron1 give pron1 absolution   when dorian have finish the letter pron1 feel that pron1 have be forgive 

suddenly pron1 come a knock to the door and pron1 hear person1 person1 be voice outside   pron1 dear boy pron1 must see pron1   let pron1 in at once   pron1 can not bear pron1 shut pron1 up like this

  pron1 dear person1 answer person1 person1 take a cigarette from pron1 case and produce a gold latten matchbox the only way a woman can ever reform a man be by bore pron1 so completely that pron1 lose all possible interest in life   if pron1 have marry this girl pron1 would have be wretched   of course pron1 would have treat pron1 kindly   ordinal1 can always be kind to people about pron1 pron1 care pron1   but pron1 would have soon find out that pron1 be absolutely indifferent to pron1   and when a woman find that out about pron1 husband pron1 either become dreadfully dowdy or wear very smart bonnet pron1 some other woman be husband have to pay for   pron1 say pron1 about the social mistake which would have be abject which of course pron1 would not have allow but pron1 assure pron1 that in any case the whole thing would have be an absolute failure   

  pron1 suppose pron1 would muttered the lad walk up and down the room and look horribly pale   but pron1 think pron1 be pron1 duty   pron1 be not pron1 fault that this terrible tragedy have prevent pron1 do pron1 be right   pron1 remember pron1 saying once that pron1 be a fatality about good resolution pron1 pron1 be always make too late   person1 certainly be   

  good resolution be useless attempt to interfere with scientific law   pron1 origin be pure vanity   pron1 result be absolutely nil   pron1 give pron1 now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotion pron1 have a certain charm for the weak   that be all pron1 can be say for pron1   pron1 be simply cheque pron1 man draw on a bank where pron1 have no account   

  person1 cry dorian gray come over and sit down beside pron1 why be pron1 that pron1 can not feel this tragedy as much as pron1 want to   pron1 do not think pron1 be heartless   do pron1   

  pron1 have do too many foolish thing during the last fortnight to be entitle to give pron1 that name person1 answer person1 person1 with pron1 sweet melancholy smile 

the lad frown   pron1 do not like that explanation person1 pron1 rejoin but pron1 be glad pron1 do not think pron1 be heartless   pron1 be pron1 of the kind   pron1 know pron1 be not   and yet pron1 must admit that this thing pron1 have happen do not affect pron1 as pron1 should   pron1 seem to pron1 to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play   pron1 have all the terrible beauty of a greek tragedy a tragedy in which pron1 take a great part but by which pron1 have not be wound   

  pron1 be an interesting question say person1 person1 pron1 find an exquisite pleasure in play on the lad be unconscious egotism an extremely interesting question   pron1 fancy that the true explanation be this pron1 often happen that the real tragedy of life occur in such an inartistic manner pron1 pron1 hurt pron1 by pron1 crude violence pron1 absolute incoherence pron1 absurd want of mean pron1 entire lack of style   pron1 affect pron1 just as vulgarity affect pron1   pron1 give pron1 an impression of sheer brute force and pron1 revolt against that   sometimes however a tragedy pron1 possess artistic element of beauty cross pron1 life   if these element of beauty be real the whole thing simply appeal to pron1 sense of dramatic effect   suddenly pron1 find that pron1 be no long the actor but the spectator of the play   or rather pron1 be both   pron1 watch pron1 and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthrall pron1   in the present case pron1 be pron1 pron1 have really happen   some one have kill pron1 for love of pron1   pron1 wish that pron1 have ever have such an experience   pron1 would have make pron1 in love with love for the rest of pron1 life   the people pron1 have adore pron1 pron1 have not be very many but pron1 have be some have always insist on live on long after pron1 have cease to care for pron1 or pron1 to care for pron1   pron1 have become stout and tedious and when pron1 meet pron1 pron1 go in at once for reminiscence   that awful memory of woman   pron1 a fearful thing pron1 be   and pron1 an utter intellectual stagnation pron1 reveal   pron1 should absorb the colour of life but pron1 should never remember pron1 detail   detail be always vulgar   

  pron1 must sow poppy in pron1 garden sigh dorian 

  pron1 be no necessity rejoin pron1 companion   person1 have always poppy in pron1 hand   of course now and then thing linger   pron1 once wear pron1 but violet all through ordinal1 season as a form of artistic mourning for a romance pron1 would not die   ultimately however pron1 do die   pron1 forget pron1 kill pron1   pron1 think pron1 be pron1 propose to sacrifice the whole world for pron1   that be always a dreadful moment   pron1 fill ordinal1 with the terror of eternity   well would pron1 believe pron1   a week ago at person1 person1 be pron1 find pron1 seat at dinner next the lady in question and pron1 insist on go over the whole thing again and dig up the past and rake up the future   pron1 have bury pron1 romance in a bed of asphodel   pron1 drag pron1 out again and assure pron1 that pron1 have spoil pron1 life   pron1 be bind to state that pron1 eat an enormous dinner so pron1 do not feel any anxiety   but pron1 a lack of taste pron1 show   the ordinal1 charm of the past be that pron1 be the past   but woman never know when the curtain have fall   pron1 always want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the play be entirely over pron1 propose to continue pron1   if pron1 be allow pron1 own way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce   pron1 be charmingly artificial but pron1 have no sense of art   pron1 be more fortunate than pron1 be   pron1 assure pron1 dorian that not ordinal1 of the woman pron1 have know would have do for pron1 pron1 person1 person1 do for pron1   ordinary woman always console pron1   some of pron1 do pron1 by go in for sentimental colour   never trust a woman pron1 wear mauve whatever pron1 age may be or a woman over ordinal1 ordinal1 pron1 be fond of pink ribbon   pron1 always mean that pron1 have a history   other find a great consolation in suddenly discover the good quality of pron1 husband   pron1 flaunt pron1 conjugal felicity in ordinal1 be face as if pron1 be the most fascinating of sin   religion console some   pron1 mystery have all the charm of a flirtation a woman once tell pron1 and pron1 can quite understand pron1   besides pron1 make ordinal1 so vain as be tell that pron1 be a sinner   person1 make egotist of pron1 all   yes   pron1 be really no end to the consolation pron1 woman find in modern life   indeed pron1 have not mention the most important one   

  pron1 be that person1   say the lad listlessly 

  oh the obvious consolation   take some one else be admirer when pron1 lose ordinal1 be own   in good society pron1 always whitewash a woman   but really dorian how different person1 person1 must have be from all the woman pron1 meet   pron1 be pron1 to pron1 quite beautiful about pron1 death   pron1 be glad pron1 be live in a century when such wonder happen   pron1 make ordinal1 believe in the reality of the thing pron1 all play with such as romance passion and love   

  pron1 be terribly cruel to pron1   pron1 forget that   

  pron1 be afraid that woman appreciate cruelty downright cruelty more than pron1 else   pron1 have wonderfully primitive instinct   pron1 have emancipate pron1 but pron1 remain slave look for pron1 master all the same   pron1 love be dominate   pron1 be sure pron1 be splendid   pron1 have never see pron1 really and absolutely angry but pron1 can fancy how delightful pron1 look   and after all pron1 say pron1 to pron1 the day before yesterday pron1 seem to pron1 at the time to be merely fanciful but that pron1 see now be absolutely true and pron1 hold the key to pron1   

  pron1 be that person1   

  pron1 say to pron1 that person1 vane represent to pron1 all the heroine of romance that pron1 be person1 ordinal1 night and ophelia the other   that if pron1 die as person1 pron1 come to life as person1   

  pron1 will never come to life again now mutter the lad bury pron1 face in pron1 hand 

  no pron1 will never come to life   pron1 have play pron1 last part   but pron1 must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some jacobean tragedy as a wonderful scene from person1 or person1 or person1 tourneur   the girl never really live and so pron1 have never really die   to pron1 at least pron1 be always a dream a phantom pron1 flit through shakespeare be play and leave pron1 lovely for pron1 presence a reed through which shakespeare be music sound rich and more full of joy   the moment pron1 touch actual life pron1 mar pron1 and pron1 mar pron1 and so pron1 pass away   person1 for person1 if pron1 like   put ashe on pron1 head because cordelia be strangle   cry out against heaven because the daughter of person1 die   but do not waste pron1 tear over person1 person1   pron1 be less real than pron1 be   

pron1 be a silence   the evening darken in the room   noiselessly and with silver foot the shadow creep in from the garden   the colour fade wearily out of thing 

after some time dorian gray look up   pron1 have explain pron1 to pron1 person1 pron1 murmur with pron1 of a sigh of relief   pron1 feel all pron1 pron1 have say but somehow pron1 be afraid of pron1 and pron1 could not express pron1 to pron1   how well pron1 know pron1   but pron1 will not talk again of pron1 have happen   pron1 have be a marvellous experience   that be all   pron1 wonder if life have still in store for pron1 pron1 as marvellous   

  life have pron1 in store for pron1 dorian   pron1 be pron1 pron1 pron1 with pron1 extraordinary good look will not be able to do   

  but suppose person1 pron1 become haggard and old and wrinkled   pron1 then   

  ah then say person1 person1 rise to go then pron1 dear dorian pron1 would have to fight for pron1 victory   as pron1 be pron1 be bring to pron1   no pron1 must keep pron1 good look   pron1 live in an age pron1 read too much to be wise and that think too much to be beautiful   pron1 can not spare pron1   and now pron1 have well dress and drive down to the club   pron1 be rather late as pron1 be   

  pron1 think pron1 shall join pron1 at the opera person1   pron1 feel too tired to eat pron1   pron1 be the number of pron1 sister be box   

  ordinal1 ordinal1 pron1 believe   pron1 be on the grand tier   pron1 will see pron1 name on the door   but pron1 be sorry pron1 will not come and dine   

  pron1 do not feel up to pron1 say dorian listlessly   but pron1 be awfully oblige to pron1 for all pron1 pron1 have say to pron1   pron1 be certainly pron1 good friend   no one have ever understand pron1 as pron1 have   

  pron1 be only at the beginning of pron1 friendship dorian answer person1 person1 shake pron1 by the hand   good bye   pron1 shall see pron1 before ordinal1 ordinal1 pron1 hope   person1 person1 be singe   

as pron1 close the door behind pron1 dorian gray touch the bell and in a few minute victor appear with the lamp and draw the blind down   pron1 wait impatiently for pron1 to go   the man seem to take an interminable time over pron1 

as soon as pron1 have leave pron1 rush to the screen and draw pron1 back   no   pron1 be no further change in the picture   pron1 have receive the news of person1 person1 be death before pron1 have know of pron1 pron1   pron1 be conscious of the event of life as pron1 occur   the vicious cruelty pron1 mar the fine line of the mouth have no doubt appear at the very moment that the girl have drink the poison whatever pron1 be   or be pron1 indifferent to result   do pron1 merely take cognizance of pron1 pass within the soul   pron1 wonder and hope that some day pron1 would see the change take place before pron1 very eye shudder as pron1 hope pron1 

poor sibyl   pron1 a romance pron1 have all be   pron1 have often mimic death on the stage   then death pron1 have touch pron1 and take pron1 with pron1   how have pron1 play that dreadful last scene   have pron1 curse pron1 as pron1 die   no   pron1 have die for love of pron1 and love would always be a sacrament to pron1 now   pron1 have atone for pron1 by the sacrifice pron1 have make of pron1 life   pron1 would not think any more of pron1 pron1 have make pron1 go through on that horrible night at the theatre   when pron1 think of pron1 pron1 would be as a wonderful tragic figure send on to the world be stage to show the supreme reality of love   a wonderful tragic figure   tear come to pron1 eye as pron1 remember pron1 childlike look and winsome fanciful way and shy tremulous grace   pron1 brush pron1 away hastily and look again at the picture 

pron1 feel that the time have really come for make pron1 choice   or have pron1 choice already be make   yes life have decide that for pron1 life and pron1 own infinite curiosity about life   eternal youth infinite passion pleasure subtle and secret wild joy and wild sin pron1 be to have all these thing   the portrait be to bear the burden of pron1 shame pron1 be all 

a feeling of pain creep over pron1 as pron1 think of the desecration pron1 be in store for the fair face on the canvas   once in boyish mockery of narcissus pron1 have kiss or feign to kiss those paint lip pron1 now smile so cruelly at pron1   person1 after morning pron1 have sit before the portrait wonder at pron1 beauty almost enamoured of pron1 as pron1 seem to pron1 at time   be pron1 to alter now with every mood to which pron1 yield   be pron1 to become a monstrous and loathsome thing to be hide away in a locked room to be shut out from the sunlight pron1 have so often touch to bright gold the wave wonder of pron1 hair   the pity of pron1   the pity of pron1 

for a moment pron1 think of pray that the horrible sympathy pron1 exist between pron1 and the picture might cease   pron1 have change in answer to a prayer   perhaps in answer to a prayer pron1 might remain unchanged   and yet pron1 that know pron1 about life would surrender the chance of remain always young however fantastic that chance might be or with pron1 fateful consequence pron1 might be fraught   besides be pron1 really under pron1 control   have pron1 indeed be prayer pron1 have produce the substitution   might pron1 not be some curious scientific reason for pron1 all   if thought could exercise pron1 influence upon a live organism might not think exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic thing   person1 without thought or conscious desire might not thing external to pron1 vibrate in unison with pron1 mood and passion atom call to atom in secret love or strange affinity   but the reason be of no importance   pron1 would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power   if the picture be to alter pron1 be to alter   that be all   why inquire too closely into pron1 

for pron1 would be a real pleasure in watch pron1   pron1 would be able to follow pron1 mind into pron1 secret place   this portrait would be to pron1 the most magical of mirror   as pron1 have reveal to pron1 pron1 own body so pron1 would reveal to pron1 pron1 own soul   and when winter come upon pron1 pron1 would still be stand where spring tremble on the verge of summer   when the blood creep from pron1 face and leave behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eye pron1 would keep the glamour of person1   not ordinal1 blossom of pron1 loveliness would ever fade   not ordinal1 pulse of pron1 life would ever weaken   like the god of the person1 pron1 would be strong and fleet and joyous   pron1 do pron1 matter pron1 happen to the coloured image on the canvas   pron1 would be safe   that be pron1 

pron1 draw the screen back into pron1 former place in front of the picture smile as pron1 do so and pass into pron1 bedroom where pron1 valet be already wait for pron1   an hour later pron1 be at the opera and person1 person1 be lean over pron1 chair

  pron1 dear basil how do pron1 know   murmured dorian gray sip some pale yellow wine from a delicate gold bead bubble of venetian glass and look dreadfully bored   pron1 be at the opera   pron1 should have come on there   pron1 meet person1 person1 person1 be sister for the first time   pron1 be in pron1 box   pron1 be perfectly charming   and person1 sing divinely   do not talk about horrid subject   if pron1 do not talk about a thing pron1 have never happen   pron1 be simply expression as person1 say that give reality to thing   pron1 may mention that pron1 be not the woman be only child   pron1 be a son a charming fellow pron1 believe   but pron1 be not on the stage   pron1 be a sailor or pron1   and now tell pron1 about pron1 and pron1 pron1 be paint   

  pron1 go to the opera   person1 hallward speak very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in pron1 voice   pron1 go to the opera while person1 person1 be lie dead in some sordid lodging   pron1 can talk to pron1 of other woman be charming and of person1 singe divinely before the girl pron1 love have even the quiet of a grave to sleep in   why man pron1 be horror in store for that little white body of pron1

  pron1 call yesterday the past   

  pron1 have the actual lapse of time get to do with pron1   pron1 be only shallow people pron1 require year to get rid of an emotion   a man pron1 be master of pron1 can end a sorrow as easily as pron1 can invent a pleasure   pron1 do not want to be at the mercy of pron1 emotion   pron1 want to use pron1 to enjoy pron1 and to dominate pron1   

  dorian this be horrible   pron1 have change pron1 completely   pron1 look exactly the same wonderful boy pron1 day after day use to come down to pron1 studio to sit for pron1 picture   but pron1 be simple natural and affectionate then   pron1 be the most unspoiled creature in the whole world   now pron1 do not know pron1 have come over pron1   pron1 talk as if pron1 have no heart no pity in pron1   pron1 be all person1 be influence   pron1 see that   

the lad flush up and go to the window look out for a few moment on the green flicker sun lash garden   pron1 owe a great deal to person1 person1 pron1 say at last more than pron1 owe to pron1   pron1 only teach pron1 to be vain   

  well pron1 be punish for that dorian or shall be some day   

  pron1 do not know pron1 pron1 mean basil pron1 exclaim turn round   pron1 do not know pron1 pron1 want   pron1 do pron1 want

the eld man bury pron1 face in pron1 hand   how fearful pron1 mutter and a shudder run through pron1 

  no say dorian gray pron1 be pron1 fearful about pron1   pron1 be ordinal1 of the great romantic tragedy of the age   as a rule people pron1 act lead the most commonplace life   pron1 be good husband or faithful wife or pron1 tedious   pron1 know pron1 pron1 mean middle class virtue and all that kind of thing   how different sibyl be   pron1 live pron1 fine tragedy   pron1 be always a heroine   the last night pron1 play the night pron1 see pron1 pron1 act badly because pron1 have know the reality of love   when pron1 know pron1 unreality pron1 die as person1 might have die   pron1 pass again into the sphere of art   pron1 be pron1 of the martyr about pron1   pron1 death have all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom all pron1 waste beauty   but as pron1 be say pron1 must not think pron1 have not suffer   if pron1 have come in yesterday at a particular moment about half past ordinal1 perhaps or a quarter to ordinal1 pron1 would have find pron1 in tear   even person1 pron1 be here pron1 bring pron1 the news in fact have no idea pron1 pron1 be go through   pron1 suffer immensely   then pron1 pass away   pron1 can not repeat an emotion   no one can except sentimentalist   and pron1 be awfully unjust basil   pron1 come down here to console pron1   that be charming of pron1   pron1 find pron1 console and pron1 be furious   how like a sympathetic person   pron1 remind pron1 of a story person1 tell pron1 about a certain philanthropist pron1 spend ordinal1 year of pron1 life in try to get some grievance redress or some unjust law alter pron1 forget exactly pron1 pron1 be   finally pron1 succeed and pron1 could exceed pron1 disappointment   pron1 have absolutely pron1 to do almost die of ennui and become a confirmed misanthrope   and besides pron1 dear old basil if pron1 really want to console pron1 teach pron1 rather to forget pron1 have happen or to see pron1 from a proper artistic point of view   be pron1 not gautier pron1 use to write about la consolation person1 art   pron1 remember pick up a little vellum cover book in pron1 studio ordinal1 day and chance on that delightful phrase   well pron1 be not like that young man pron1 tell pron1 of when pron1 be down at person1 together the young man pron1 use to say that yellow person1 could console ordinal1 for all the misery of life   pron1 love beautiful thing pron1 pron1 can touch and handle   old brocade person1 bronze lacquer work carve ivory exquisite surrounding person1 person1 pron1 be much to be get from all these   but the artistic temperament pron1 pron1 create or at any rate reveal be still more to pron1   to become the spectator of ordinal1 be own life as person1 say be to escape the suffering of life   pron1 know pron1 be surprised at pron1 talk to pron1 like this   pron1 have not realize how pron1 have develop   pron1 be a schoolboy when pron1 know pron1   pron1 be a man now   pron1 have new passion new thought new idea   pron1 be different but pron1 must not like pron1 less   pron1 be change but pron1 must always be pron1 friend   of course pron1 be very fond of person1   but pron1 know that pron1 be well than pron1 be   pron1 be not strong pron1 be too much afraid of life but pron1 be well   and how happy pron1 use to be together   do not leave pron1 basil and do not quarrel with pron1   pron1 be pron1 pron1 be   pron1 be pron1 more to be say   

the painter feel strangely move   the lad be infinitely dear to pron1 and pron1 personality have be the great turning point in pron1 art   pron1 could not bear the idea of reproach pron1 any more   after all pron1 indifference be probably merely a mood pron1 would pass away   pron1 be so much in pron1 pron1 be good so much in pron1 pron1 be noble 

  well dorian pron1 say at length with a sad smile pron1 will not speak to pron1 again about this horrible thing after to day   pron1 only trust pron1 name will not be mention in connection with pron1   the inquest be to take place this afternoon   have pron1 summon pron1   

person1 shake pron1 head and a look of annoyance pass over pron1 face at the mention of the word inquest   pron1 be pron1 so crude and vulgar about pron1 of the kind   pron1 do not know pron1 name pron1 answer 

  but surely pron1 do   

  only pron1 christian name and that pron1 be quite sure pron1 never mention to any one   pron1 tell pron1 once that pron1 be all rather curious to learn pron1 pron1 be and that pron1 invariably tell pron1 pron1 name be prince charming   pron1 be pretty of pron1   pron1 must do pron1 a drawing of sibyl basil   pron1 should like to have pron1 more of pron1 than the memory of a few kiss and some broken pathetic word   

  pron1 will try and do pron1 dorian if pron1 would please pron1   but pron1 must come and sit to pron1 pron1 again   pron1 can not get on without pron1   

  pron1 can never sit to pron1 again basil   pron1 be impossible   pron1 exclaim start back 

the painter stare at pron1   pron1 dear boy what nonsense   pron1 cry   do pron1 mean to say pron1 do not like pron1 pron1 do of pron1   where be pron1   why have pron1 pull the screen in front of pron1   let pron1 look at pron1   pron1 be the good thing pron1 have ever do   do take the screen away dorian   pron1 be simply disgraceful of pron1 servant hide pron1 work like that   pron1 feel the room look different as pron1 come in   

  pron1 servant have pron1 to do with pron1 basil   pron1 do not imagine pron1 let pron1 arrange pron1 room for pron1   pron1 settle pron1 flower for pron1 sometimes that be all   no   pron1 do pron1 pron1   the light be too strong on the portrait   

  too strong   surely not pron1 dear fellow   pron1 be an admirable place for pron1   let pron1 see pron1   and person1 walk towards the corner of the room 

a cry of terror break from dorian gray be lip and pron1 rush between the painter and the screen   person1 pron1 say look very pale pron1 must not look at pron1   pron1 do not wish pron1 to   

  not look at pron1 own work   pron1 be not serious   why should not pron1 look at pron1   person1 hallward laugh 

  if pron1 try to look at pron1 basil on pron1 word of honour pron1 will never speak to pron1 again as long as pron1 live   pron1 be quite serious   pron1 do not offer any explanation and pron1 be not to ask for any   but remember if pron1 touch this screen pron1 be over between pron1   

person1 be thunderstruck   pron1 look at dorian gray in absolute amazement   pron1 have never see pron1 like this before   the lad be actually pallid with rage   pron1 hand be clench and the pupil of pron1 eye be like disk of blue fire   pron1 be tremble all over 

  dorian   

  do not speak   

  but pron1 be the matter   of course pron1 will not look at pron1 if pron1 do not want pron1 to pron1 say rather coldly turn on pron1 heel and go over towards the window   but really pron1 seem rather absurd that pron1 should not see pron1 own work especially as pron1 be go to exhibit pron1 in person1 in the autumn   pron1 shall probably have to give pron1 another coat of varnish before that so pron1 must see pron1 some day and why not to day   

  to exhibit pron1   pron1 want to exhibit pron1   person1 person1 gray a strange sense of terror creep over pron1   be the world go to be show pron1 secret   be people to gape at the mystery of pron1 life   that be impossible   pron1 pron1 do not know pron1 have to be do at once 

  yes   pron1 do not suppose pron1 will object to that   person1 person1 be go to collect all pron1 good picture for a special exhibition in the rue de person1 which will open the first week in person1   the portrait will only be away a month   pron1 should think pron1 could easily spare pron1 for that time   in fact pron1 be sure to be out of town   and if pron1 keep pron1 always behind a screen pron1 can not care much about pron1   

dorian gray pass pron1 hand over pron1 forehead   pron1 be bead of perspiration there   pron1 feel that pron1 be on the brink of a horrible danger   pron1 tell pron1 a month ago that pron1 would never exhibit pron1 pron1 cry   why have pron1 change pron1 mind   pron1 people pron1 go in for be consistent have just as many mood as other have   the only difference be that pron1 mood be rather meaningless   pron1 can not have forget that pron1 assure pron1 most solemnly that pron1 in the world would induce pron1 to send pron1 to any exhibition   pron1 tell person1 exactly the same thing   pron1 stop suddenly and a gleam of light come into pron1 eye   pron1 remember that person1 person1 have say to pron1 once half seriously and half in jest if pron1 want to have a strange quarter of an hour get basil to tell pron1 why pron1 will not exhibit pron1 picture   pron1 tell pron1 why pron1 would not and pron1 be a revelation to pron1   yes perhaps basil too have pron1 secret   pron1 would ask pron1 and try 

  basil pron1 say come over quite close and look pron1 straight in the face pron1 have each of pron1 a secret   let pron1 know pron1 and pron1 shall tell pron1 mine   pron1 be pron1 reason for refuse to exhibit pron1 picture   

the painter shudder in spite of pron1   person1 if pron1 tell pron1 pron1 might like pron1 less than pron1 do and pron1 would certainly laugh at pron1   pron1 could not bear pron1 do either of those ordinal1 thing   if pron1 wish pron1 never to look at pron1 picture again pron1 be content   pron1 have always pron1 to look at   if pron1 wish the good work pron1 have ever do to be hide from the world pron1 be satisfied   pron1 friendship be dear to pron1 than any fame or reputation   

  no basil pron1 must tell pron1 insist dorian gray   pron1 think pron1 have a right to know   pron1 feeling of terror have pass away and curiosity have take pron1 place   pron1 be determined to find out basil person1 be mystery 

  let pron1 sit down person1 say the painter look troubled   let pron1 sit down   and just answer pron1 ordinal1 question   have pron1 notice in the picture pron1 curious   pron1 pron1 probably at first do not strike pron1 but that reveal pron1 to pron1 suddenly   

  basil   cry the lad clutch the arm of pron1 chair with tremble hand and gaze at pron1 with wild startled eye 

  pron1 see pron1 do   do not speak   wait till pron1 hear pron1 pron1 have to say   person1 from the moment pron1 meet pron1 pron1 personality have the most extraordinary influence over pron1   pron1 be dominate soul brain and power by pron1   pron1 become to pron1 the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunt person1 artist like an exquisite dream   pron1 worship pron1   pron1 grow jealous of every one to pron1 pron1 speak   pron1 want to have pron1 all to pron1   pron1 be only happy when pron1 be with pron1   when pron1 be away from pron1 pron1 be still present in pron1 art         of course pron1 never let pron1 know pron1 about this   pron1 would have be impossible   pron1 would not have understand pron1   pron1 hardly understand pron1 pron1   pron1 only know that pron1 have see perfection face to face and that the world have become wonderful to pron1 eye too wonderful perhaps for in such mad worship pron1 be peril the peril of lose pron1 no less than the peril of keep pron1         week and week go on and pron1 grow more and more absorbed in pron1   then come a new development   pron1 have draw pron1 as person1 in dainty armour and as adoni with huntsman be cloak and polished boar spear   crown with heavy lotus blossom pron1 have sit on the prow of person1 be barge gaze across the person1 person1 person1   pron1 have lean over the still pool of some greek woodland and see in the water be silent silver the marvel of pron1 own face   and pron1 have all be pron1 art should be unconscious ideal and remote   ordinal1 day a fatal day pron1 sometimes think pron1 determine to paint a wonderful portrait of pron1 as pron1 actually be not in the costume of dead age but in pron1 own dress and in pron1 own time   whether pron1 be the realism of the method or the mere wonder of pron1 own personality thus directly present to pron1 without mist or veil pron1 can not tell   but pron1 know that as pron1 work at pron1 every flake and film of colour seem to pron1 to reveal pron1 secret   pron1 grow afraid that other would know of pron1 idolatry   pron1 feel dorian that pron1 have tell too much that pron1 have put too much of pron1 into pron1   then pron1 be that pron1 resolve never to allow the picture to be exhibit   pron1 be a little annoyed   but then pron1 do not realize all pron1 pron1 mean to pron1   person1 to pron1 pron1 talk about pron1 laugh at pron1   but pron1 do not mind that   when the picture be finish and pron1 sit alone with pron1 pron1 feel that pron1 be right         well after a few day the thing leave pron1 studio and as soon as pron1 have get rid of the intolerable fascination of pron1 presence pron1 seem to pron1 that pron1 have be foolish in imagine that pron1 have see pron1 in pron1 more than that pron1 be extremely good looking and that pron1 could paint   even now pron1 can not help feel that pron1 be a mistake to think that the passion pron1 feel in creation be ever really show in the work one create   art be always more abstract than pron1 fancy   form and colour tell pron1 of form and colour pron1 be all   pron1 often seem to pron1 that art conceal the artist far more completely than pron1 ever reveal pron1   and so when pron1 get this offer from person1 pron1 determine to make pron1 portrait the principal thing in pron1 exhibition   pron1 never occur to pron1 that pron1 would refuse   pron1 see now that pron1 be right   the picture can not be show   pron1 must not be angry with pron1 dorian for pron1 pron1 have tell pron1   as pron1 say to person1 once pron1 be make to be worship   

dorian gray draw a long breath   the colour come back to pron1 cheek and a smile play about pron1 lip   the peril be over   pron1 be safe for the time   yet pron1 could not help feel infinite pity for the painter pron1 have just make this strange confession to pron1 and wonder if pron1 pron1 would ever be so dominate by the personality of a friend   person1 person1 have the charm of be very dangerous   but that be all   pron1 be too clever and too cynical to be really fond of   would pron1 ever be some ordinal1 pron1 would fill pron1 with a strange idolatry   be that ordinal1 of the thing pron1 life have in store 

  pron1 be extraordinary to pron1 person1 say hallward that pron1 should have see this in the portrait   do pron1 really see pron1   

  pron1 see pron1 in pron1 pron1 answer pron1 pron1 seem to pron1 very curious   

  well pron1 do not mind pron1 look at the thing now   

person1 shake pron1 head   pron1 must not ask pron1 that basil   pron1 could not possibly let pron1 stand in front of that picture   

  pron1 will some day surely   

  never   

  well perhaps pron1 be right   and now good bye dorian   pron1 have be the ordinal1 person in pron1 life pron1 have really influence pron1 art   whatever pron1 have do that be good pron1 owe to pron1   ah   pron1 do not know pron1 pron1 cost pron1 to tell pron1 all pron1 pron1 have tell pron1   

  pron1 dear basil say dorian pron1 have pron1 tell pron1   simply that pron1 feel that pron1 admire pron1 too much   that be not even a compliment   

  pron1 be not intend as a compliment   pron1 be a confession   now that pron1 have make pron1 pron1 seem to have go out of pron1   perhaps pron1 should never put ordinal1 be worship into word   

  pron1 be a very disappointing confession   

  why pron1 do pron1 expect dorian   pron1 do not see pron1 else in the picture do pron1   pron1 be pron1 else to see   

  no   pron1 be pron1 else to see   why do pron1 ask   but pron1 must not talk about worship   pron1 be foolish   pron1 and pron1 be friend basil and pron1 must always remain so   

  pron1 have get person1 say the painter sadly 

  oh person1   cry the lad with a ripple of laughter   person1 spend pron1 day in say pron1 be incredible and pron1 evening in do pron1 be improbable   just the sort of life pron1 would like to lead   but still pron1 do not think pron1 would go to person1 if pron1 be in trouble   pron1 would soon go to pron1 basil   

  pron1 will sit to pron1 again   

  impossible   

  pron1 spoil pron1 life as an artist by refuse dorian   no man come across ordinal1 ideal thing   few come across ordinal1   

  pron1 can not explain pron1 to pron1 basil but pron1 must never sit to pron1 again   pron1 be pron1 fatal about a portrait   pron1 have a life of pron1 own   pron1 will come and have tea with pron1   that will be just as pleasant   

  pleasanter for pron1 pron1 be afraid murmur hallward regretfully   and now good bye   pron1 be sorry pron1 will not let pron1 look at the picture once again   but that can not be help   pron1 quite understand pron1 pron1 feel about pron1   

as pron1 leave the room dorian gray smile to pron1   poor basil   how little pron1 know of the true reason   and how strange pron1 be that instead of have be force to reveal pron1 own secret pron1 have succeed almost by chance in wrest a secret from pron1 friend   how much that strange confession explain to pron1   the painter be absurd fit of jealousy pron1 wild devotion pron1 extravagant panegyric pron1 curious reticence pron1 understand pron1 all now and pron1 feel sorry   pron1 seem to pron1 to be pron1 tragic in a friendship so colour by romance 

pron1 sigh and touch the bell   the portrait must be hide away at all cost   pron1 could not run such a risk of discovery again   pron1 have be mad of pron1 to have allow the thing to remain even for an hour in a room to which any of pron1 friend have access 

chapter 
when pron1 servant enter pron1 look at pron1 steadfastly and wonder if pron1 have think of peer behind the screen   the man be quite impassive and wait for pron1 order   person1 light a cigarette and walk over to the glass and glance into pron1   pron1 could see the reflection of person1 be face perfectly   pron1 be like a placid mask of servility   pron1 be pron1 to be afraid of there   yet pron1 think pron1 well to be on pron1 guard 

speak very slowly pron1 tell pron1 to tell the house keeper that pron1 want to see pron1 and then to go to the frame maker and ask pron1 to send ordinal1 of pron1 man round at once   pron1 seem to pron1 that as the man leave the room pron1 eye wander in the direction of the screen   or be that merely pron1 own fancy 

after a few moment in pron1 black silk dress with old fashioned thread mitten on pron1 wrinkled hand person1   person1 bustle into the library   pron1 ask pron1 for the key of the schoolroom 

  the old schoolroom person1   person1   pron1 exclaim   why pron1 be full of dust   pron1 must get pron1 arrange and put straight before pron1 go into pron1   pron1 be not fit for pron1 to see sir   pron1 be not indeed   

  pron1 do not want pron1 put straight leaf   pron1 only want the key   

  well sir pron1 will be cover with cobwebs if pron1 go into pron1   why pron1 have not be open for nearly ordinal1 year not since pron1 lordship die   

pron1 wince at the mention of pron1 grandfather   pron1 have hateful memory of pron1   that do not matter pron1 answer   pron1 simply want to see the place pron1 be all   give pron1 the key   

  and here be the key sir say the old lady go over the content of pron1 bunch with tremulously uncertain hand   here be the key   pron1 will have pron1 off the bunch in a moment   but pron1 do not think of live up there sir and pron1 so comfortable here   

  no no pron1 cry petulantly   thank pron1 leaf   that will do   

pron1 linger for a few moment and be garrulous over some detail of the household   pron1 sigh and tell pron1 to manage thing as pron1 think well   pron1 leave the room wreathe in smile 

as the door close dorian put the key in pron1 pocket and look round the room   pron1 eye fall on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroider with gold a splendid piece of late seventeenth century venetian work pron1 pron1 grandfather have find in a convent near person1   yes that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in   pron1 have perhaps serve often as a pall for the dead   now pron1 be to hide pron1 pron1 have a corruption of pron1 own bad than the corruption of death pron1 pron1 pron1 would breed horror and yet would never die   pron1 the worm be to the corpse pron1 sin would be to the paint image on the canvas   pron1 would mar pron1 beauty and eat away pron1 grace   pron1 would defile pron1 and make pron1 shameful   and yet the thing would still live on   pron1 would be always alive 

pron1 shudder and for a moment pron1 regret that pron1 have not tell basil the true reason why pron1 have wish to hide the picture away   person1 would have help pron1 to resist person1 person1 be influence and the still more poisonous influence pron1 come from pron1 own temperament   the love pron1 pron1 bear pron1 for pron1 be really love have pron1 in pron1 pron1 be not noble and intellectual   pron1 be not that mere physical admiration of beauty pron1 be bear of the sense and that die when the sense tire   pron1 be such love as person1 have know and person1 and person1 and shakespeare pron1   yes basil could have save pron1   but pron1 be too late now   the past could always be annihilate   person1 denial or forgetfulness could do that   but the future be inevitable   pron1 be passion in pron1 pron1 would find pron1 terrible outlet dream pron1 would make the shadow of pron1 evil real 

pron1 take up from the couch the great purple and gold texture pron1 cover pron1 and hold pron1 in pron1 hand pass behind the screen   be the face on the canvas viler than before   pron1 seem to pron1 that pron1 be unchanged and yet pron1 loathing of pron1 be intensify   gold hair blue eye and rise red lip pron1 all be there   pron1 be simply the expression pron1 have alter   that be horrible in pron1 cruelty   compare to pron1 pron1 see in pron1 of censure or rebuke how shallow basil be reproach about person1 person1 have be   how shallow and of what little account   pron1 own soul be look out at pron1 from the canvas and call pron1 to judgement   a look of pain come across pron1 and pron1 fling the rich pall over the picture   as pron1 do so a knock come to the door   pron1 pass out as pron1 servant enter 

  the person be here person1   

pron1 feel that the man must be get rid of at once   pron1 must not be allow to know where the picture be be take to   pron1 be pron1 sly about pron1 and pron1 have thoughtful treacherous eye   sit down at the writing table pron1 scribble a note to person1 person1 ask pron1 to send pron1 round pron1 to read and remind pron1 that pron1 be to meet at ordinal1 ordinal1 that evening 

  wait for an answer pron1 say hand pron1 to pron1 and show the man in here   

in ordinal1 or ordinal1 minute pron1 be another knock and person1   person1 pron1 the celebrated frame maker of person1 person1 street come in with a somewhat rough look young assistant   person1   person1 be a florid red whisker little man whose admiration for art be considerably temper by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artist pron1 deal with pron1   as a rule pron1 never leave pron1 shop   pron1 wait for people to come to pron1   but pron1 always make an exception in favour of dorian gray   pron1 be pron1 about dorian pron1 charm pron1   pron1 be a pleasure even to see pron1 

  pron1 can pron1 do for pron1 person1   person1   pron1 say rub pron1 fat freckle hand   pron1 think pron1 would do pron1 the honour of come round in person   pron1 have just get a beauty of a frame sir   pick pron1 up at a sale   person1 person1   come from fonthill pron1 believe   admirably suited for a religious subject person1   person1   

  pron1 be so sorry pron1 have give pron1 the trouble of come round person1   person1   pron1 shall certainly drop in and look at the frame though pron1 do not go in much at present for religious art but to day pron1 only want a picture carry to the top of the house for pron1   pron1 be rather heavy so pron1 think pron1 would ask pron1 to lend pron1 a couple of pron1 man

on reach the library pron1 find that pron1 be just after ordinal1 o clock and that the tea have be already bring up   on a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrust with person1 a present from person1 person1 pron1 guardian be wife a pretty professional invalid pron1 have spend the precede winter in person1 be lie a note from person1 person1 and beside pron1 be a book bind in yellow paper the cover slightly tear and the edge soil   a copy of the third edition of the person1   person1 be person1 have be place on the tea tray   pron1 be evident that victor have return   pron1 wonder if pron1 have meet the man in the hall as pron1 be leave the house and have worm out of pron1 pron1 pron1 have be do   pron1 would be sure to miss the picture have no doubt miss pron1 already while pron1 have be lay the tea thing   the screen have not be set back and a blank space be visible on the wall   perhaps some night pron1 might find pron1 creep upstairs and try to force the door of the room   pron1 be a horrible thing to have a spy in ordinal1 be house   pron1 have hear of rich man pron1 have be blackmail all pron1 life by some servant pron1 have read a letter or overhear a conversation or pick up a card with an address or find beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumple lace 

pron1 sigh and have pour pron1 out some tea open person1 person1 be note   pron1 be simply to say that pron1 send pron1 round the evening paper and a book pron1 might interest pron1 and that pron1 would be at the club at ordinal1 ordinal1   pron1 open the person1   person1 be languidly and look through pron1   a red pencil mark on the fifth page catch pron1 eye   pron1 draw attention to the follow paragraph

perhaps pron1 have read pron1 and have begin to suspect pron1   and yet pron1 do pron1 matter   pron1 have dorian gray to do with person1 person1 be death   pron1 be pron1 to fear   dorian gray have not kill pron1 

pron1 eye fall on the yellow book pron1 person1 person1 have send pron1   pron1 be pron1 pron1 wonder   pron1 go towards the little pearl colour octagonal stand pron1 have always look to pron1 like the work of some strange egyptian bee pron1 work in silver and take up the volume fling pron1 into an arm chair and begin to turn over the leave   after a few minute pron1 become absorb   pron1 be the strange book pron1 pron1 have ever read   pron1 seem to pron1 that in exquisite raiment and to the delicate sound of flute the sin of the world be pass in dumb show before pron1   thing pron1 pron1 have dimly dream of be suddenly make real to pron1   thing of which pron1 have never dream be gradually reveal 

pron1 be a novel without a plot and with only ordinal1 character be indeed simply a psychological study of a certain young parisian pron1 spend pron1 life try to realize in the nineteenth century all the passion and mode of thought pron1 belong to every century except pron1 own and to sum up as pron1 be in pron1 the various mood through which the world person1 have ever pass love for pron1 mere artificiality those renunciation that man have unwisely call virtue as much as those natural rebellion pron1 wise man still call sin   the style in which pron1 be write be that curious jewel style vivid and obscure at once full of person1 and of archaism of technical expression and of elaborate paraphrase pron1 characterize the work of some of the fine artist of the french school of symboliste   pron1 be in pron1 metaphor as monstrous as orchid and as subtle in colour   the life of the sense be describe in the term of mystical philosophy   ordinal1 hardly know at time whether pron1 be read the spiritual ecstasy of some mediæval saint or the morbid confession of a modern sinner   pron1 be a poisonous book   the heavy odour of incense seem to cling about pron1 page and to trouble the brain   the mere cadence of the sentence the subtle monotony of pron1 music so full as pron1 be of complex refrain and movement elaborately repeat produce in the mind of the lad as pron1 pass from chapter to chapter a form of reverie a malady of dream pron1 make pron1 unconscious of the fall day and creep shadow 

cloudless and pierce by ordinal1 solitary star a copper green sky gleam through the window   pron1 read on by pron1 person1 light till pron1 could read no more   then after pron1 valet have remind pron1 several time of the lateness of the hour pron1 get up and go into the next room place the book on the little florentine table pron1 always stand at pron1 bedside and begin to dress for dinner 

pron1 be almost ordinal1 o clock before pron1 reach the club where pron1 find person1 person1 sit alone in the morning room look very much bored 

  pron1 be so sorry person1 pron1 cry but really pron1 be entirely pron1 fault   that book pron1 send pron1 so fascinate pron1 that pron1 forget how the time be go   

  yes pron1 think pron1 would like pron1 reply pron1 host rise from pron1 chair 

  pron1 do not say pron1 like pron1 person1   pron1 say pron1 fascinate pron1   pron1 be a great difference   

  ah pron1 have discover that   person1 person1 person1   and pron1 pass into the dining room 

chapter xi 
for year dorian gray could not free pron1 from the influence of this book   or perhaps pron1 would be more accurate to say that pron1 never seek to free pron1 from pron1   pron1 procure from person1 no less than ordinal1 large paper copy of the first edition and have pron1 bind in different colour so that pron1 might suit pron1 various mood and the change fancy of a nature over which pron1 seem at time to have almost entirely lose control   the hero the wonderful young parisian in pron1 the romantic and the scientific temperament be so strangely blend become to pron1 a kind of prefigure type of pron1   and indeed the whole book seem to pron1 to contain the story of pron1 own life write before pron1 have live pron1 

in ordinal1 point pron1 be more fortunate than the novel be fantastic hero   pron1 never know never indeed have any cause to know that somewhat grotesque dread of mirror and polished metal surface and still water which come upon the young parisian so early in pron1 life and be occasion by the sudden decay of a beau pron1 have once apparently be so remarkable   pron1 be with an almost cruel joy and perhaps in nearly every joy as certainly in every pleasure cruelty have pron1 place pron1 pron1 use to read the latter part of the book with pron1 really tragic if somewhat overemphasize account of the sorrow and despair of ordinal1 pron1 have pron1 lose pron1 in other and the world pron1 have most dearly value 

for the wonderful beauty pron1 have so fascinated basil person1 and many other besides pron1 seem never to leave pron1   even those pron1 have hear the most evil thing against pron1 and from time to time strange rumour about pron1 mode of life creep through person1 and become the chatter of the club could not believe pron1 to pron1 dishonour when pron1 see pron1   pron1 have always the look of ordinal1 pron1 have keep pron1 unspotted from the world   man pron1 talk grossly become silent when dorian gray enter the room   pron1 be pron1 in the purity of pron1 face pron1 rebuke pron1   pron1 mere presence seem to recall to pron1 the memory of the innocence pron1 pron1 have tarnish   pron1 wonder how ordinal1 so charming and graceful as pron1 be could have escape the stain of an age pron1 be at once sordid and sensual 

often on return home from ordinal1 of those mysterious and prolonged absence pron1 give rise to such strange conjecture among those pron1 be pron1 friend or think that pron1 be so pron1 pron1 would creep upstairs to the locked room open the door with the key pron1 never leave pron1 now and stand with a mirror in front of the portrait pron1 person1 person1 have paint of pron1 look now at the evil and age face on the canvas and now at the fair young face pron1 laugh back at pron1 from the polished glass   the very sharpness of the contrast use to quicken pron1 sense of pleasure   pron1 grow more and more enamoured of pron1 own beauty more and more interested in the corruption of pron1 own soul   pron1 would examine with minute care and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight the hideous line pron1 sear the wrinkle forehead or crawl around the heavy sensual mouth wonder sometimes which be the more horrible the sign of sin or the sign of age   pron1 would place pron1 white hand beside the coarse bloated hand of the picture and smile   pron1 mock the misshapen body and the fail limb 

pron1 be moment indeed at night when lie sleepless in pron1 own delicately scented chamber or in the sordid room of the little ill fame tavern near the dock which under an assumed name and in disguise pron1 be pron1 habit to frequent pron1 would think of the ruin pron1 have bring upon pron1 soul with a pity pron1 be all the more poignant because pron1 be purely selfish   but moment such as these be rare   that curiosity about life which person1 person1 have first stir in pron1 as pron1 sit together in the garden of pron1 friend seem to increase with gratification   the more pron1 know the more pron1 desire to know   pron1 have mad hunger pron1 grow more ravenous as pron1 feed pron1 

yet pron1 be not really reckless at any rate in pron1 relation to society   once or twice every month during the winter and on each person1 evening while the season last pron1 would throw open to the world pron1 beautiful house and have the most celebrated musician of the day to charm pron1 guest with the wonder of pron1 art   pron1 little dinner in the settling of which person1 person1 always assist pron1 be note as much for the careful selection and placing of those invite as for the exquisite taste show in the decoration of the table with pron1 subtle symphonic arrangement of exotic flower and embroider cloth and antique plate of gold and silver   indeed pron1 be many especially among the very young man pron1 see or fancy that pron1 see in dorian gray the true realization of a type of which pron1 have often dream in person1 or person1 day a type pron1 be to combine pron1 of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world   to pron1 pron1 seem to be of the company of those pron1 person1 describe as have seek to make pron1 perfect by the worship of beauty   like gautier pron1 be ordinal1 for pron1 the visible world exist   

and certainly to pron1 life pron1 be the first the great of the art and for pron1 all the other art seem to be but a preparation   person1 by which pron1 be really fantastic become for a moment universal and dandyism which in pron1 own way be an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty have of course pron1 fascination for pron1   pron1 mode of dressing and the particular style that from time to time pron1 affect have pron1 mark influence on the young exquisite of the mayfair ball and pall mall club window pron1 copy pron1 in pron1 pron1 pron1 do and try to reproduce the accidental charm of pron1 graceful though to pron1 only half serious fopperie 

for while pron1 be but too ready to accept the position pron1 be almost immediately offer to pron1 on pron1 coming of age and find indeed a subtle pleasure in the thought that pron1 might really become to the person1 of pron1 own day pron1 to imperial person1 person1 the author of the satyricon once have be yet in pron1 inmost heart pron1 desire to be pron1 more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum to be consult on the wearing of a jewel or the knotting of a necktie or the conduct of a cane   pron1 seek to elaborate some new scheme of life pron1 would have pron1 reasoned philosophy and pron1 order principle and find in the spiritualizing of the sense pron1 high realization 

the worship of the sense have often and with much justice be decry man feel a natural instinct of terror about passion and sensation pron1 seem strong than pron1 and that pron1 be conscious of share with the less highly organize form of existence   but pron1 appear to dorian gray that the true nature of the sense have never be understand and that pron1 have remain savage and animal merely because the world have seek to starve pron1 into submission or to kill pron1 by pain instead of aim at make pron1 element of a new spirituality of which a fine instinct for beauty be to be the dominant characteristic   as pron1 look back upon man move through history pron1 be haunt by a feeling of loss   so much have be surrender   and to such little purpose   pron1 have be mad wilful rejection monstrous form of self torture and self denial whose origin be fear and whose result be a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancy degradation from which in pron1 ignorance pron1 have seek to escape   nature in pron1 wonderful irony drive out the anchorite to feed with the wild animal of the desert and give to the hermit the beast of the field as pron1 companion 

yes pron1 be to be as person1 person1 have prophesy a new hedonism pron1 be to recreate life and to save pron1 from that harsh uncomely puritanism pron1 be have in pron1 own day pron1 curious revival   pron1 be to have pron1 service of the intellect certainly yet pron1 be never to accept any theory or system pron1 would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience   pron1 aim indeed be to be experience pron1 and not the fruit of experience sweet or bitter as pron1 might be   of the asceticism pron1 deaden the sense as of the vulgar profligacy pron1 dull pron1 pron1 be to know pron1   but pron1 be to teach man to concentrate pron1 upon the moment of a life pron1 be pron1 but a moment 

pron1 be few of pron1 pron1 have not sometimes waken before dawn either after ordinal1 of those dreamless night pron1 make pron1 almost enamoured of death or ordinal1 of those night of horror and misshapen joy when through the chamber of the brain sweep phantom more terrible than reality pron1 and instinct with that vivid life pron1 lurk in all grotesque and that lend to gothic art pron1 endure vitality this art be ordinal1 might fancy especially the art of those whose mind have be trouble with the malady of reverie   gradually white finger creep through the curtain and pron1 appear to tremble   in black fantastic shape dumb shadow crawl into the corner of the room and crouch there   outside pron1 be the stirring of bird among the leave or the sound of man go forth to pron1 work or the sigh and sob of the wind come down from the hill and wander round the silent house as though pron1 fear to wake the sleeper and yet must need call forth sleep from pron1 purple cave   person1 after veil of thin dusky gauze be lift and by degree the form and colour of thing be restore to pron1 and pron1 watch the dawn remake the world in pron1 antique pattern   the person1 mirror get back pron1 mimic life   the flameless taper stand where pron1 have leave pron1 and beside pron1 lie the half cut book pron1 pron1 have be study or the wired flower pron1 pron1 have wear at the ball or the letter pron1 pron1 have be afraid to read or that pron1 have read too often   pron1 seem to pron1 change   out of the unreal shadow of the night come back the real life pron1 pron1 have know   pron1 have to resume pron1 where pron1 have leave off and pron1 steal over pron1 a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habit or a wild longing pron1 may be that pron1 eyelid might open some morning upon a world pron1 have be refashion anew in the darkness for pron1 pleasure a world in which thing would have fresh shape and colour and be change or have other secret a world in which the past would have little or no place or survive at any rate in no conscious form of obligation or regret the remembrance even of joy have pron1 bitterness and the memory of pleasure pron1 pain 

pron1 be the creation of such world as these pron1 seem to dorian gray to be the true object or amongst the true object of life   and in pron1 search for sensation pron1 would be at once new and delightful and possess that element of strangeness pron1 be so essential to romance pron1 would often adopt certain mode of thought that pron1 know to be really alien to pron1 nature abandon pron1 to pron1 subtle influence and then have as pron1 be catch pron1 colour and satisfy pron1 intellectual curiosity leave pron1 with that curious indifference pron1 be not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament and that indeed accord to certain modern psychologist be often a condition of pron1 

pron1 be rumour of pron1 once that pron1 be about to join the person1 person1 person1 and certainly the roman ritual have always a great attraction for pron1   the daily sacrifice more awful really than all the sacrifice of the antique world stir pron1 as much by pron1 superb rejection of the evidence of the sense as by the primitive simplicity of pron1 element and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy pron1 pron1 seek to symbolize   pron1 love to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest in pron1 stiff flower dalmatic slowly and with white hand move aside the veil of the tabernacle or raise aloft the jewel lantern shape monstrance with that pallid wafer pron1 at time pron1 would fain think be indeed the panis cælestis the bread of angel or robe in the garment of the passion of person1 break the host into the chalice and smite pron1 breast for pron1 sin   the fume censer pron1 the grave boy in pron1 lace and scarlet toss into the air like great gilt flower have pron1 subtle fascination for pron1   as pron1 pass out pron1 use to look with wonder at the black confessional and long to sit in the dim shadow of ordinal1 of pron1 and listen to man and woman whisper through the worn grate the true story of pron1 life 

but pron1 never fall into the error of arrest pron1 intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system or of mistake for a house in which to live an inn pron1 be but suitable for the sojourn of a night or for a few hour of a night in which pron1 be no star and the moon be in travail   person1 with pron1 marvellous power of make common thing strange to pron1 and the subtle antinomianism pron1 always seem to accompany pron1 move pron1 for a season   and for a season pron1 incline to the materialistic doctrine of the darwinismus movement in person1 and find a curious pleasure in trace the thought and passion of man to some pearly cell in the brain or some white nerve in the body delight in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical condition morbid or healthy normal or diseased   yet as have be say of pron1 before no theory of life seem to pron1 to be of any importance compare with life pron1   pron1 feel keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation be when separate from action and experiment   pron1 know that the sense no less than the soul have pron1 spiritual mystery to reveal 

and so pron1 would now study perfume and the secret of pron1 manufacture distil heavily scented oil and burn odorous gum from the east   pron1 see that pron1 be no mood of the mind pron1 have not pron1 counterpart in the sensuous life and set pron1 to discover pron1 true relation wonder pron1 pron1 be in frankincense pron1 make ordinal1 mystical and in ambergris pron1 stir ordinal1 be passion and in violet pron1 wake the memory of dead romance and in musk pron1 trouble the brain and in champak pron1 stain the imagination   and seek often to elaborate a real psychology of perfume and to estimate the several influence of sweet smell root and scented pollen person1 flower   of aromatic balm and of dark and fragrant wood   of spikenard pron1 sicken   of hovenia pron1 make man mad   and of aloe pron1 be say to be able to expel melancholy from the soul 

at another time pron1 devote pron1 entirely to music and in a long latticed room with a vermilion and gold ceiling and wall of olive green lacquer pron1 use to give curious concert in which mad gipsy tear wild music from little zither or grave yellow shawle person1 pluck at the strained string of monstrous lute while grin negro beat monotonously upon copper drum and crouch upon scarlet mat slim turbane person1 blow through long pipe of reed or brass and charm or feign to charm great hooded snake and horrible horned adder   the harsh interval and shrill discord of barbaric music stir pron1 at time when person1 be grace and person1 be beautiful sorrow and the mighty harmony of person1 pron1 fall unheeded on pron1 ear   pron1 collect together from all part of the world the strange instrument pron1 could be find either in the tomb of dead nation or among the few savage tribe pron1 have survive contact with western civilization and love to touch and try pron1   pron1 have the mysterious juruparis of the person1 person1 person1 that woman be not allow to look at and that even youth may not see till pron1 have be subject to fast and scourge and the earthen jar of the peruvian pron1 have the shrill cry of bird and flute of human bone such as person1 person1 person1 hear in chile and the sonorous green jasper pron1 be find near cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness   pron1 have paint gourd fill with pebble pron1 rattle when pron1 be shake   the long clarin of the mexican into which the performer do not blow but through which pron1 inhale the air   the harsh ture of the amazon tribe pron1 be sound by the sentinel pron1 sit all day long in high tree and can be hear pron1 be say at a distance of ordinal1 league   the teponaztli pron1 have ordinal1 vibrate tongue of wood and be beat with stick pron1 be smear with an elastic gum obtain from the milky juice of plant   the yotl bell of the aztecs pron1 be hang in cluster like grape   and a huge cylindrical drum cover with the skin of great serpent like the one pron1 person1 person1 see when pron1 go with corte into the person1 temple and of whose doleful sound pron1 have leave pron1 so vivid a description   the fantastic character of these instrument fascinate pron1 and pron1 feel a curious delight in the thought that art like nature have pron1 monster thing of bestial shape and with hideous voice   yet after some time pron1 weary of pron1 and would sit in pron1 box at the opera either alone or with person1 person1 listen in rapt pleasure to person1 and see in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of pron1 own soul 

on ordinal1 occasion pron1 take up the study of jewel and appear at a costume ball as person1 person1 person1 person1 of person1 in a dress cover with ordinal1 ordinal1 and ordinal1 pearl   this taste enthral pron1 for year and indeed may be say never to have leave pron1   pron1 would often spend a whole day settle and resettle in pron1 case the various stone pron1 pron1 have collect such as the person1 person1 person1 pron1 turn red by lamplight the cymophane with pron1 wirelike line of silver the pistachio colour peridot rise pink and wine yellow topaz carbuncle of fiery scarlet with tremulous ordinal1 ray star flame red person1 person1 person1 and violet spinel and amethyst with pron1 alternate layer of ruby and sapphire   pron1 love the red gold of the sunstone and the moonstone be pearly whiteness and the broken rainbow of the milky opal   pron1 procure from person1 ordinal1 emerald of extraordinary size and richness of colour and have a turquoise de la vieille person1 pron1 be the envy of all the connoisseur

for these treasure and pron1 pron1 pron1 collect in pron1 lovely house be to be to pron1 mean of forgetfulness mode by which pron1 could escape for a season from the fear pron1 seem to pron1 at time to be almost too great to be bear   upon the wall of the lonely locked room where pron1 have spend so much of pron1 boyhood pron1 have hang with pron1 own hand the terrible portrait whose change feature show pron1 the real degradation of pron1 life and in front of pron1 have drape the purple and gold pall as a curtain   for week pron1 would not go there would forget the hideous paint thing and get back pron1 light heart pron1 wonderful joyousness pron1 passionate absorption in mere existence   then suddenly some night pron1 would creep out of the house go down to dreadful place near person1 gate field and stay there day after day until pron1 be drive away   on pron1 return pron1 would sit in front of the picture sometimes loathe pron1 and pron1 but fill at other time with that pride of individualism pron1 be half the fascination of sin and smile with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow pron1 have to bear the burden pron1 should have be pron1 own 

after a few year pron1 could not endure to be long out of person1 and give up the villa that pron1 have share at person1 with person1 person1 as well as the little white wall in house at algier where pron1 have more than once spend the winter   pron1 hate to be separate from the picture pron1 be such a part of pron1 life and be also afraid that during pron1 absence some pron1 might gain access to the room in spite of the elaborate bar pron1 pron1 have cause to be place upon the door 

pron1 be quite conscious that this would tell pron1 pron1   pron1 be true that the portrait still preserve under all the foulness and ugliness of the face pron1 marked likeness to pron1   but pron1 could pron1 learn from that   pron1 would laugh at any one pron1 try to taunt pron1   pron1 have not paint pron1   pron1 be pron1 to pron1 how vile and full of shame pron1 look   even if pron1 tell pron1 would pron1 believe pron1 

yet pron1 be afraid   sometimes when pron1 be down at pron1 great house in nottinghamshire entertain the fashionable young man of pron1 own rank pron1 be pron1 chief companion and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of pron1 mode of life pron1 would suddenly leave pron1 guest and rush back to town to see that the door have not be tamper with and that the picture be still there   pron1 if pron1 should be steal   the mere thought make pron1 cold with horror   surely the world would know pron1 secret then   perhaps the world already suspect pron1 

for while pron1 fascinate many pron1 be not a few pron1 distrust pron1   pron1 be very nearly blackball at a west end club of which pron1 birth and social position fully entitle pron1 to become a member and pron1 be say that on ordinal1 occasion when pron1 be bring by a friend into the smoking room of the person1 the duke of person1 and another gentleman get up in a marked manner and go out   curious story become current about pron1 after pron1 have pass pron1 ordinal1 fifth year   pron1 be rumour that pron1 have be see brawl with foreign sailor in a low den in the distant part of person1 and that pron1 consort with thief and coiner and know the mystery of pron1 trade   pron1 extraordinary absence become notorious and when pron1 use to reappear again in society man would whisper to each other in corner or pass pron1 with a sneer or look at pron1 with cold searching eye as though pron1 be determined to discover pron1 secret 

of such insolence and attempt slight pron1 of course take no notice and in the opinion of most people pron1 person1 person1 manner pron1 charming boyish smile and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth pron1 seem never to leave pron1 be in pron1 a sufficient answer to the calumny for so pron1 term pron1 pron1 be circulate about pron1   pron1 be remark however that some of those pron1 have be most intimate with pron1 appear after a time to shun pron1   woman pron1 have wildly adore pron1 and for pron1 sake have brave all social censure and set convention at defiance be see to grow pallid with shame or horror if dorian gray enter the room 

yet these whisper scandal only increase in the eye of many pron1 strange and dangerous charm   pron1 great wealth be a certain element of security   person1 civilized society at least be never very ready to believe pron1 to the detriment of those pron1 be both rich and fascinating   pron1 feel instinctively that manner be of more importance than moral and in pron1 opinion the high respectability be of much less value than the possession of a good chef   and after all pron1 be a very poor consolation to be tell that the man pron1 have give ordinal1 a bad dinner or poor wine be irreproachable in pron1 private life   even the cardinal virtue can not atone for half cold entrées as person1 person1 remark once in a discussion on the subject and pron1 be possibly a good deal to be say for pron1 view   for the canon of good society be or should be the same as the canon of art   form be absolutely essential to pron1   pron1 should have the dignity of a ceremony as well as pron1 unreality and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty pron1 make such play delightful to pron1   be insincerity such a terrible thing   pron1 think not   pron1 be merely a method by which pron1 can multiply pron1 personality 

such at any rate be dorian gray be opinion   pron1 use to wonder at the shallow psychology of those pron1 conceive the ego in man as a thing simple permanent reliable and of ordinal1 essence   to pron1 man be a be with myriad life and myriad sensation a complex multiform creature pron1 bear within pron1 strange legacy of thought and passion and whose very flesh be taint with the monstrous malady of the dead   pron1 love to stroll through the gaunt cold picture gallery of pron1 country house and look at the various portrait of those whose blood flow in pron1 vein   here be person1 person1 describe by person1 person1 in pron1 memoire on the reign of person1 person1 and person1 person1 as ordinal1 pron1 be caress by the court for pron1 handsome face which keep pron1 not long company   be pron1 young person1 be life pron1 pron1 sometimes lead   have some strange poisonous germ creep from body to body till pron1 have reach pron1 own   be pron1 some dim sense of that ruin grace pron1 have make pron1 so suddenly and almost without cause give utterance in person1 person1 be studio to the mad prayer pron1 have so change pron1 life   here in gold embroider red doublet jewel surcoat and gilt edge ruff and wristband stand person1 person1 person1 with pron1 silver and black armour pile at pron1 foot   pron1 have this man be legacy be   have the lover of person1 of person1 bequeath pron1 some inheritance of sin and shame   be pron1 own action merely the dream that the dead man have not dare to realize   here from the fade canvas smile person1 person1 person1 in pron1 gauze hood pearl stomacher and pink slash sleeve   a flower be in pron1 right hand and pron1 leave clasp an enamelled collar of white and damask rose   on a table by pron1 side lie a mandolin and an apple   pron1 be large green rosette upon pron1 little pointed shoe   pron1 know pron1 life and the strange story pron1 be tell about pron1 lover   have pron1 pron1 of pron1 temperament in pron1   these oval heavy lidde eye seem to look curiously at pron1   pron1 of person1 person1 with pron1 powdered hair and fantastic patch   how evil pron1 look   the face be saturnine and swarthy and the sensual lip seem to be twist with disdain   delicate lace ruffle fall over the lean yellow hand pron1 be so overladen with ring   pron1 have be a macaroni of the eighteenth century and the friend in pron1 youth of person1 person1   pron1 of the second person1 person1 the companion of the person1 regent in pron1 wild day and ordinal1 of the witness at the secret marriage with person1   person1   how proud and handsome pron1 be with pron1 chestnut curl and insolent pose   what passion have pron1 bequeath   the world have look upon pron1 as infamous   pron1 have lead the orgy at person1 person1   the star of the garter glitter upon pron1 breast   beside pron1 hang the portrait of pron1 wife a pallid thin lipped woman in black   pron1 blood also stir within pron1   how curious pron1 all seem   and pron1 mother with pron1 person1 person1 face and pron1 moist wine dash lip pron1 know pron1 pron1 have get from pron1   pron1 have get from pron1 pron1 beauty and pron1 passion for the beauty of other   pron1 laugh at pron1 in pron1 loose person1 dress   pron1 be vine leave in pron1 hair   the purple spill from the cup pron1 be hold   the carnation of the painting have wither but the eye be still wonderful in pron1 depth and brilliancy of colour   pron1 seem to follow pron1 wherever pron1 go

an exclamation of horror break from the painter be lip as pron1 see in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grin at pron1   pron1 be pron1 in pron1 expression pron1 fill pron1 with disgust and loathing   good heaven   pron1 be dorian gray be own face that pron1 be look at   the horror whatever pron1 be have not yet entirely spoil that marvellous beauty   pron1 be still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth   the sodden eye have keep pron1 of the loveliness of pron1 blue the noble curve have not yet completely pass away from chisel nostril and from plastic throat   yes pron1 be dorian pron1   but pron1 have do pron1   pron1 seem to recognize pron1 own brushwork and the frame be pron1 own design   the idea be monstrous yet pron1 feel afraid   pron1 seize the light candle and hold pron1 to the picture   in the left hand corner be pron1 own name trace in long letter of bright vermilion 

pron1 be some foul parody some infamous ignoble satire   pron1 have never do that   still pron1 be pron1 own picture   pron1 know pron1 and pron1 feel as if pron1 blood have change in a moment from fire to sluggish ice   pron1 own picture   pron1 do pron1 mean   why have pron1 alter   pron1 turn and look at dorian gray with the eye of a sick man   pron1 mouth twitch and pron1 parched tongue seem unable to articulate   pron1 pass pron1 hand across pron1 forehead   pron1 be dank with clammy sweat 

the young man be lean against the mantelshelf watch pron1 with that strange expression that pron1 see on the face of those pron1 be absorb in a play when some great artist be act   pron1 be neither real sorrow in pron1 nor real joy   pron1 be simply the passion of the spectator with perhaps a flicker of triumph in pron1 eye   pron1 have take the flower out of pron1 coat and be smell pron1 or pretend to do so 

  pron1 do this mean   cry hallward at last   pron1 own voice sound shrill and curious in pron1 ear

  pron1 be the face of pron1 soul   

  person1   pron1 a thing pron1 must have worship   pron1 have the eye of a devil   

  each of pron1 have person1 and hell in pron1 basil cry dorian with a wild gesture of despair 

person1 turn again to the portrait and gaze at pron1   pron1 god   if pron1 be true pron1 exclaim and this be pron1 pron1 have do with pron1 life why pron1 must be bad even than those pron1 talk against pron1 fancy pron1 to be   pron1 hold the light up again to the canvas and examine pron1   the surface seem to be quite undisturbed and as pron1 have leave pron1   pron1 be from within apparently that the foulness and horror have come   through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosy of sin be slowly eat the thing away   the rotting of a corpse in a watery grave be not so fearful 

pron1 hand shake and the candle fall from pron1 socket on the floor and lie there sputter   pron1 place pron1 foot on pron1 and put pron1 out   then pron1 fling pron1 into the rickety chair pron1 be stand by the table and bury pron1 face in pron1 hand

dorian gray turn slowly around and look at pron1 with tear dim eye   pron1 be too late basil pron1 falter 

  pron1 be never too late dorian   let pron1 kneel down and try if pron1 can not remember a prayer   be not there a verse somewhere though pron1 sin be as scarlet yet pron1 will make pron1 as white as snow     

  those word mean pron1 to pron1 now   

  hush   do not say that   pron1 have do enough evil in pron1 life   pron1 god   do not pron1 see that accursed thing leer at pron1   

dorian gray glance at the picture and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for basil person1 come over pron1 as though pron1 have be suggest to pron1 by the image on the canvas whisper into pron1 ear by those grin lip   the mad passion of a hunted animal stir within pron1 and pron1 loathe the man pron1 be seat at the table more than in pron1 whole life pron1 have ever loathe pron1   pron1 glance wildly around   pron1 glimmer on the top of the paint chest pron1 face pron1   pron1 eye fall on pron1   pron1 know pron1 pron1 be   pron1 be a knife pron1 pron1 have bring up some day before to cut a piece of cord and have forget to take away with pron1   pron1 move slowly towards pron1 pass hallward as pron1 do so   as soon as pron1 get behind pron1 pron1 seize pron1 and turn round   person1 stir in pron1 chair as if pron1 be go to rise   pron1 rush at pron1 and dig the knife into the great vein pron1 be behind the ear crush the man be head down on the table and stab again and again 

pron1 be a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some ordinal1 choke with blood   ordinal1 time the outstretched arm shoot up convulsively wave grotesque stiff fingered hand in the air   pron1 stab pron1 twice more but the man do not move   pron1 begin to trickle on the floor   pron1 wait for a moment still press the head down   then pron1 throw the knife on the table and listen 

pron1 could hear pron1 but the drip drip on the threadbare carpet   pron1 open the door and go out on the landing   the house be absolutely quiet   no one be about   for a few second pron1 stand bend over the balustrade and peer down into the black seething well of darkness   then pron1 take out the key and return to the room lock pron1 in as pron1 do so 

the thing be still seat in the chair strain over the table with bow head and hump back and long fantastic arm   have pron1 not be for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clot black pool pron1 be slowly widen on the table pron1 would have say that the man be simply asleep 

how quickly pron1 have all be do   pron1 feel strangely calm and walk over to the window open pron1 and step out on the balcony   the wind have blow the fog away and the sky be like a monstrous peacock be tail star with myriad of golden eye   pron1 look down and see the policeman go pron1 round and flash the long beam of pron1 lantern on the door of the silent house   the crimson spot of a prowl person1 gleam at the corner and then vanish   a woman in a fluttering shawl be creep slowly by the railing staggering as pron1 go   now and then pron1 stop and peer back   once pron1 begin to sing in a hoarse voice   the policeman stroll over and say pron1 to pron1   pron1 stumble away laugh   a bitter blast sweep across the square   the gas lamp flicker and become blue and the leafless tree shake pron1 black iron branch to and fro   pron1 shiver and go back close the window behind pron1 

have reach the door pron1 turn the key and open pron1   pron1 do not even glance at the murder man   pron1 feel that the secret of the whole thing be not to realize the situation   the friend pron1 have paint the fatal portrait to which all pron1 misery have be due have go out of pron1 life   that be enough 

then pron1 remember the lamp   pron1 be a rather curious ordinal1 of moorish workmanship make of dull silver inlay with arabesque of burnished steel and stud with coarse turquoise   perhaps pron1 might be miss by pron1 servant and question would be ask   pron1 hesitate for a moment then pron1 turn back and take pron1 from the table   pron1 could not help see the dead thing   how still pron1 be   how horribly white the long hand look   pron1 be like a dreadful wax image 

have lock the door behind pron1 pron1 creep quietly downstairs   the woodwork creak and seem to cry out as if in pain   pron1 stop several time and wait   no pron1 be still   pron1 be merely the sound of pron1 own footstep 

when pron1 reach the library pron1 see the bag and coat in the corner   pron1 must be hide away somewhere   pron1 unlock a secret press pron1 be in the wainscoting a press in which pron1 keep pron1 own curious disguise and put pron1 into pron1   pron1 could easily burn pron1 afterwards   then pron1 pull out pron1 watch   pron1 be ordinal1 minute to ordinal1 

pron1 sit down and begin to think   every year every month almost man be strangle in person1 for pron1 pron1 have do   pron1 have be a madness of murder in the air   some red star have come too close to the earth         and yet what evidence be there against pron1   person1 hallward have leave the house at ordinal1   no one have see pron1 come in again   most of the servant be at person1 person1   pron1 valet have go to bed         person1   yes   pron1 be to person1 that basil have go and by the midnight train as pron1 have intend   with pron1 curious reserved habit pron1 would be month before any suspicion would be rouse   month   pron1 could be destroy long before then 

a sudden thought strike pron1   pron1 put on pron1 fur coat and hat and go out into the hall   there pron1 pause hear the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and see the flash of the bull be eye reflect in the window   pron1 wait and hold pron1 breath 

after a few moment pron1 draw back the latch and slip out shut the door very gently behind pron1   then pron1 begin ring the bell   in about ordinal1 minute pron1 valet appear half dressed and look very drowsy

the moon hang low in the sky like a yellow skull   from time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretch a long arm across and hide pron1   the gas lamp grow few and the street more narrow and gloomy   once the man lose pron1 way and have to drive back half a mile   a steam rise from the horse as pron1 splash up the puddle   the sidewindow of the person1 be clog with a grey flannel mist 

  to cure the soul by mean of the sense and the sense by mean of the soul   how the word ring in pron1 ear   pron1 soul certainly be sick to death   be pron1 true that the sense could cure pron1   innocent blood have be spill   pron1 could atone for that   ah   for that pron1 be no atonement   but though forgiveness be impossible forgetfulness be possible still and pron1 be determined to forget to stamp the thing out to crush pron1 as pron1 would crush the adder pron1 have sting ordinal1   indeed pron1 right have basil to have speak to pron1 as pron1 have do   pron1 have make pron1 a judge over other   pron1 have say thing pron1 be dreadful horrible not to be endure

the way seem interminable and the street like the black web of some sprawl spider   the monotony become unbearable and as the mist thicken pron1 feel afraid 

then pron1 pass by lonely brickfield   the fog be light here and pron1 could see the strange bottle shape kiln with pron1 orange fanlike tongue of fire   a dog bark as pron1 go by and far away in the darkness some wander sea gull scream   the horse stumble in a rut then swerve aside and break into a gallop 

after some time pron1 leave the clay road and rattle again over rough person1 street   most of the window be dark but now and then fantastic shadow be silhouette against some lamplit blind   pron1 watch pron1 curiously   pron1 move like monstrous marionette and make gesture like live thing   pron1 hate pron1   a dull rage be in pron1 heart   as pron1 turn a corner a woman yell pron1 at pron1 from an open door and ordinal1 man run after the person1 for about a ordinal1 yard   the driver beat at pron1 with pron1 whip 

pron1 be say that passion make pron1 think in a circle   certainly with hideous iteration the bite lip of dorian gray shape and reshape those subtle word pron1 deal with soul and sense till pron1 have find in pron1 the full expression as pron1 be of pron1 mood and justify by intellectual approval passion that without such justification would still have dominate pron1 temper   from cell to cell of pron1 brain creep the ordinal1 thought   and the wild desire to live most terrible of all man be appetite quicken into force each tremble nerve and fibre   ugliness pron1 have once be hateful to pron1 because pron1 make thing real become dear to pron1 now for that very reason   person1 be the ordinal1 reality   the coarse brawl the loathsome den the crude violence of disorder life the very vileness of thief and outcast be more vivid in pron1 intense actuality of impression than all the gracious shape of art the dreamy shadow of song   pron1 be pron1 pron1 need for forgetfulness   in ordinal1 day pron1 would be free 

suddenly the man draw up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane   over the low roof and jagged chimney stack of the house rise the black mast of ship   wreath of white mist person1 like ghostly sail to the yard 

  somewhere about here person1 be not pron1   pron1 ask huskily through the trap 

person1 start and peer round   this will do pron1 answer and have get out hastily and give the driver the extra fare pron1 have promise pron1 pron1 walk quickly in the direction of the quay   here and pron1 a lantern gleam at the stern of some huge merchantman   the light shake and splinter in the puddle   a red glare come from an outward bind steamer pron1 be coal   the slimy pavement look like a wet person1 

pron1 hurry on towards the left glance back now and then to see if pron1 be be follow   in about ordinal1 or ordinal1 minute pron1 reach a small shabby house pron1 be wedge in between ordinal1 gaunt factory   in ordinal1 of the top window stand a lamp   pron1 stop and give a peculiar knock

at the end of the room pron1 be a little staircase lead to a darken chamber   as dorian hurry up pron1 ordinal1 rickety step the heavy odour of opium meet pron1   pron1 heave a deep breath and pron1 nostril quiver with pleasure   when pron1 enter a young man with smooth yellow hair pron1 be bend over a lamp light a long thin pipe look up at pron1 and nod in a hesitate manner
