the harlot s house 
pron1 catch the tread of dancing foot 
pron1 loiter down the person1 street 
and stop beneath the harlot be house 

inside above the din and fray 
pron1 hear the loud musician play 
the treue person1 person1 of person1 

like strange mechanical grotesque 
make fantastic arabesques 
the shadow race across the blind 

pron1 watch the ghostly dancer spin 
to sound of horn and violin 
like black leave wheel in the wind 

like wire pull automaton 
slim silhouette skeleton 
go sidle through the slow quadrille 

then take each other by the hand 
and dance a stately saraband 
pron1 laughter echo thin and shrill 

sometimes a clockwork puppet press 
a phantom lover to pron1 breast 
sometimes pron1 seem to try to sing 

sometimes a horrible marionette 
come out and smoke pron1 cigarette 
upon the step like a live thing 

then turn to pron1 love pron1 say 
  the dead be dance with the dead 
the dust be whirl with the dust   

but pron1 pron1 hear the violin 
and leave pron1 side and enter in 
love pass into the house of lust 

then suddenly the tune go false 
the dancer weary of the waltz 
the shadow cease to wheel and whirl 

and down the long and silent street 
the dawn with silver sandalled foot 
creep like a frightened girl
