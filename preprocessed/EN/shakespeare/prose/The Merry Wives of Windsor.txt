note 
note pron1 
pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1   person1 page be call person1 in ordinal1 place person1   ordinal1   ordinal1 and ordinal1 and v   ordinal1   ordinal1 but pron1 have leave the text of the folio uncorrected as the mistake may have be shakespeare be own   pron1 be however possible that a transcriber or printer may have mistaken person1   for pron1   

in pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1 ordinal1 on the other hand pron1 have not hesitate to correct the reading of the folio substituting page for person1 and person1 for page because as the early quarto have the name right pron1 seem likely that the blunder be not due to shakespeare 

note person1 
pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1   here again as in line ordinal1 person1 person1 person1 read good person1 person1 person1 but pron1 have not think pron1 necessary to do more than give a specimen of such variation   person1 in order to make person1 person1 be break person1 consistent with pron1 correct pron1 throughout and substitute woulde for person1 person1 for will and so forth   as a general rule pron1 have silently follow the first folio 

note iii 
pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1   with regard to this and other passage which person1 person1 person1 person1   have insert from the early quartos pron1 rule have be to introduce between bracket such and such only as seem to be absolutely essential to the understanding of the text take care to give in the note all those which pron1 have reject 

ordinal1 
the fact that so many omission can be supply from such mutilate copy as the early quartos indicate that pron1 may be many more omission for the detection of which pron1 have no clue   the text of the merry wife give in person1 be probably print from a carelessly write copy of the author be person1 

note pron1 
pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1   perhaps as in the ordinal1 gentleman of person1 person1   ordinal1   ordinal1 and other passage some of which be mention by person1 person1 in pron1 criticism vol   person1   person1   ordinal1 person1   this vex passage may be emend by supply a word   pron1 venture to suggest person1 revolt of mine anger be dangerous   the recurrence of the same letter anger in the word wouldangerous might mislead the printer be eye and cause the omission 

note v 
person1   ordinal1   ordinal1   in the copy of person1 be edition which belong to person1 college pron1 be a ms   person1 of person1 farmer be refer to person1 person1   in support of the conjecture physician for person1   pron1 find there 

  pron1 reason the physician to pron1 love person1 

note person1 
person1   ordinal1   ordinal1 ordinal1   here again pron1 have follow the early quartos in read person1 instead of broome the name give by person1 person1   that the former be the original name be prove by the person1 in person1   ordinal1   ordinal1 where the folio make sheer nonsense 

person1 person1 suggest that the follow line ordinal1   ordinal1   ordinal1 ordinal1 

  nay pron1 will to pron1 again in name of person1 

pron1 will tell pron1 all pron1 purpose sure pron1 will come 

be intend to rhyme and therefore favour the later reading   but in this scene pron1 be no rhyme line except the couplet at the end 

on the whole pron1 seem likely that the name be alter in the stage copy at the instance of some person of the name of person1 live at windsor pron1 have sufficient acquaintance with the player or interest with pron1 patron to get pron1 do 

ordinal1 
note vii 
iii   ordinal1   ordinal1 ordinal1   person1 person1 be unquestionably right in suppose that ordinal1 part of person1 be speech be speak aside to pron1 opponent and the other part aloud   pron1 be impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone   pron1 might have be conjecture that be a parson pron1 wish to appear peacefully minded and therefore make pron1 offer of reconciliation aloud and pron1 menace in an under tone but person1 be reply shews that pron1 be the threat which have be make aloud   person1 be valour pron1 would seem have already evaporate when pron1 have a great disposition to cry ordinal1   ordinal1   ordinal1 and besides pron1 have just begin to see that pron1 be be make a laugh stock   as pron1 former speech ordinal1 ordinal1 be also conciliatory pron1 be probably speak so as to be hear by person1 only   pron1 wish to keep up pron1 credit for courage in the eye of the bystander   in the corresponding scene of the first quartos pron1 have the word person1 person1 person1 in pron1 ear and the meaning of the text may have be obscure by some omission in the folio 

note viii 
person1   ordinal1   ordinal1   no doubt pron1 be an omission here in the folio which may be partly supply from the quarto   but pron1 be probable that person1 person1 give a still full explanation of pron1 device and the ground on which the disguise be recommend to falstaff otherwise page would not have be so confident of pron1 fall into the snare 

note ix 
person1   ordinal1   ordinal1   in the edition of ordinal1 person1 read person1 person1 person1 like         but pron1 be clear from farmer be note that pron1 should be person1 person1 person1         and so pron1 be correct in the later edition of steeven   in the edition annotate by person1 mention in note v   pron1 find another conjecture of pron1 ay sir if pron1 like         or pron1 may have be ay sir an pron1 like for the word precede pron1 have be cut away by the binder 

note 
the stage direction of the early quartos be enter person1 person1 like a satyre and person1 dr like fayrie mistresse quickly like the queene of fayrie   pron1 sing a song about pron1 and afterward speake 

ordinal1 
the folio enumerate at the commencement of the scene all pron1 take part in pron1 include person1 page fairy quickly and pistol and in this place have merely enter fairy   person1 introduce person1 page as the fairy queen and at the end with waxen taper on pron1 head   pron1 however still assign the speech ordinal1 ordinal1 ordinal1 ordinal1 ordinal1 ordinal1 and ordinal1 ordinal1 to quickly   recent editor have generally give pron1 to person1 on the ground that pron1 be prove by pron1   ordinal1   ordinal1 and v   ordinal1   ordinal1 ordinal1 that pron1 be to present the fairy queen and that the character of the speech be unsuitable to person1 quickly   pron1 have be argue too that the qui   of the folio line ordinal1 may be a misprint for person1   pron1 e   person1   this however be contradict by the fact that person1 quickly play the queen in the early quartos and that the recurrence of qui   line ordinal1 prove that the printer of the first folio use either qui   or person1   indifferently as the abbreviation of quickly 

most likely in this and other respect the play be alter by pron1 author but the stage person1   be not correct throughout with sufficient care   this will account for the mistake about the colour green and white in the final scene line ordinal1 ordinal1 ordinal1 

or pron1 may suppose person1 quickly to have agree to take person1 be part in order to facilitate pron1 escape with person1
