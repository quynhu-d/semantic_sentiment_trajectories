a lover be complaint 
from off a hill whose concave womb reword 
a plaintful story from a sistering vale 
pron1 spirit to attend this double voice accord 
and down pron1 lay to list the sad tuned tale 
person1 long espy a fickle maid full pale 
tear of paper breaking ring a twain 
storm pron1 world with sorrow be wind and rain 
upon pron1 head a platted hive of straw 
which fortify pron1 visage from the sun 
person1 the thought might think sometime pron1 see 
the carcass of beauty spend and do 
time have not scythe all that youth begin 
nor youth all quit   but spite of person1 be fall rage 
some beauty peep would through lattice of sear would age 
person1 do pron1 heave pron1 napkin to pron1 eyne 
which on pron1 have conceite character 
launder the silken figure in the brine 
that season would woe have pellete in tear 
and often read pron1 content pron1 bear 
as often shriek undistinguish would woe 
in clamour of all size both high and low 
sometimes pron1 levell would eye pron1 carriage ride 
as pron1 do battery to the sphere intend 
sometime divert pron1 poor ball be tie 
to the orbed earth   sometimes pron1 do extend 
pron1 view right on   person1 pron1 gaze lend 
to every place at once and nowhere fix would 
the mind and sight person1 person1 would 
pron1 hair nor loose nor tie in formal plat 
person1 would in pron1 a careless hand of pride 
for some untuck would descend pron1 sheaved hat 
hang pron1 pale and pine cheek beside 
some in pron1 threaden fillet still do bide 
and true to bondage would not break from thence 
though slackly braid in loose negligence 
a ordinal1 favour from a maund pron1 draw 
of amber crystal and of beaded jet 
which ordinal1 by ordinal1 pron1 in a river throw 
upon whose weeping margent pron1 be set 
like usury apply wet to wet 
or monarch be hand pron1 let not bounty fall 
where want cry some but where excess beg all 
of fold schedule have pron1 many a one 
which pron1 peruse sigh would tore and give the flood 
crack would many a ring of posied gold and bone 
bid pron1 find pron1 sepulchre in mud 
find yet moe letter sadly person1 would in blood 
with sleided silk feat and affectedly 
person1 and seal would to curious secrecy 
these often bathe pron1 in pron1 fluxive eye 
and often kiss would and often gan to tear 
cry o false blood thou register of lie 
pron1 unapproved witness dost person1 bear 
ink would have seem would more black and damned here   
this say in top of rage the line pron1 rent 
big discontent so break pron1 content 
a reverend man pron1 graze pron1 cattle nigh 
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle know 
of court of city and have let go by 
the swift hour observe as pron1 fly 
towards this afflict fancy fastly draw 
and privileged by age desire to know 
in brief the ground and motive of pron1 woe 
so slide pron1 down upon pron1 grained bat 
and comely distant sit pron1 by pron1 side 
when pron1 again desire pron1 be sit 
pron1 grievance with pron1 hearing to divide 
if that from pron1 pron1 may be aught apply 
which may pron1 suffer ecstasy assuage 
  person1 promise in the charity of age 
  father pron1 say person1 in pron1 pron1 behold 
the injury of many a blasting hour 
let pron1 not tell pron1 judgment pron1 be old 
not age but sorrow over pron1 person1 power 
pron1 might as yet have be a spread flower 
fresh to pron1 if pron1 have self apply 
love to pron1 and to no love beside 
  but woe be pron1   too early pron1 attend 
a youthful suit pron1 be to gain pron1 grace 
of ordinal1 by nature be outwards so commend 
that maiden eye stick over all pron1 face 
love lack would a dwelling and make pron1 pron1 place 
and when in pron1 fair part pron1 do abide 
pron1 be new lodge and newly deified 
  pron1 browny lock do hang in crooked curl 
and every light occasion of the wind 
upon pron1 lip pron1 silken parcel hurls 
pron1 be sweet to do to do will aptly find 
each eye pron1 see pron1 do enchant the mind 
for on pron1 visage be in little drawn 
what largeness think in person1 be sawn 
  small show of man be yet upon pron1 chin 
pron1 phoenix down begin but to appear 
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin 
pron1 bare out person1 would the web pron1 seem would to wear 
yet show would pron1 visage by that cost more dear 
and nice affection waver stand in doubt 
if good be as pron1 be or good without 
  pron1 quality be beauteous as pron1 form 
for maiden tongue pron1 be and thereof free 
yet if man move pron1 be pron1 such a storm 
as oft person1 may and person1 be to see 
when wind breathe sweet untidy though pron1 be 
pron1 rudeness so with pron1 authorize youth 
do livery falseness in a pride of truth 
  well could pron1 ride and often man would say 
  pron1 horse pron1 mettle from pron1 rider take 
proud of subjection noble by the sway 
pron1 round pron1 bound what course pron1 stop 
pron1 make   
and controversy hence a question take 
whether the horse by pron1 become pron1 deed 
or pron1 pron1 manage by the well do steed 
  but quickly on this side the verdict go 
pron1 real habitude give life and grace 
to appertaining and to ornament 
accomplish would in pron1 not in pron1 case 
all aid pron1 make fair by pron1 place 
come for addition   yet pron1 purposed trim 
piece not pron1 grace but be all grace by pron1 
  so on the tip of pron1 subduing tongue 
all kind of argument and question deep 
all replication prompt and reason strong 
for pron1 advantage still do wake and sleep 
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep 
pron1 have the dialect and different skill 
catch all passion in pron1 craft of will 
  that pron1 do in the general bosom reign 
of young of old   and sex both enchant 
to dwell with pron1 in thought or to remain 
in personal duty follow where pron1 haunt 
consent bewitch would ere pron1 desire have grant 
and dialogue for pron1 pron1 pron1 would say 
ask would pron1 own will and make pron1 will obey 
  many pron1 be that do pron1 picture get 
to serve pron1 eye and in pron1 put pron1 mind 
like fool pron1 in th imagination set 
the goodly object which abroad pron1 find 
of land and mansion pron1 in thought assign would 
and labour in moe pleasure to bestow pron1 
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe pron1 
  so many have that never touch would pron1 hand 
person1 suppose pron1 mistress of pron1 heart 
pron1 woeful self pron1 do in freedom stand 
and be pron1 own fee simple not in part 
pron1 with pron1 art in youth and youth in art 
throw pron1 affection in pron1 charmed power 
reserve the stalk and give pron1 all pron1 flower 
  yet do pron1 not as some pron1 equal do 
demand of pron1 nor be desire yield 
find pron1 in honour so forbid 
with safe distance pron1 mine person1 shield 
experience for pron1 many bulwark build 
of proof new bleeding which remain would the foil 
of this false jewel and pron1 amorous spoil 
  but ah pron1 ever person1 would by precedent 
the destine ill pron1 must pron1 assay 
or force example gainst pron1 own content 
to put the by past peril in pron1 way 
person1 may stop awhile pron1 will not stay 
for when pron1 rage advice be often see 
by blunt pron1 to make pron1 wit more keen 
  nor give pron1 satisfaction to pron1 blood 
that pron1 must curb pron1 upon other proof 
to be person1 the sweet pron1 seem so good 
for fear of harm pron1 preach in pron1 behoof 
o appetite from judgment stand aloof 
the one a palate hath pron1 need will taste 
though reason weep and cry pron1 be pron1 last   
  for far pron1 could say this man be untrue 
and know the pattern of pron1 foul beguiling 
hear where pron1 plant in other orchard grow 
saw how deceit be gild in pron1 smiling 
knew vow be ever broker to defile 
thought character and word merely but art 
and bastard of pron1 foul adulterate heart 
  and long upon these term pron1 hold pron1 city 
till thus pron1 person1 besiege pron1 gentle maid 
have of pron1 suffer youth some feel pity 
and be not of pron1 holy vow afraid 
that be to ye swear to none be ever say 
for feast of love pron1 have be call would unto 
till now do person1 er invite nor never woo 
  all pron1 offence that abroad pron1 see 
be error of the blood none of the mind 
love make pron1 not with acture pron1 may be 
where neither party be nor true nor kind 
pron1 seek pron1 shame that so pron1 shame do find 
and so much less of shame in pron1 remain 
by how much of pron1 pron1 reproach contain 
  among the many that pron1 eye have see 
not ordinal1 whose flame pron1 heart so much as warm would 
or pron1 affection put to the small teen 
or any of pron1 leisures ever charm would 
harm have pron1 do to pron1 but person1 er be harm would 
keep heart in livery but mine own be free 
and reign would command in pron1 monarchy 
  look here pron1 tribute wound fancy send pron1 
of paled pearl and ruby red as blood 
figure that pron1 pron1 passion likewise lend pron1 
of grief and blush aptly understand 
in bloodless white and the encrimson would mood

  and person1 behold these talent of pron1 hair 
with twisted metal amorously person1 would

the heaven hued sapphire and the opal blend 
with object manifold each several stone 
with wit well blazon would smile or make some moan 
  person1 all these trophy of affection hot 
of pensived and subdued desire the tender 
nature hath charge pron1 that pron1 hoard pron1 not 
but yield pron1 up where pron1 pron1 must render 
that be to pron1 pron1 origin and ender 
for these of force must pron1 oblation be 
since pron1 pron1 altar pron1 enpatron pron1 
  o then advance of your pron1 phraseless hand 
whose white weigh down the airy scale of praise 
take all these simile to pron1 own command

or sister sanctify of holy note 
which late pron1 noble suit in court do shun 
whose rare having make the blossom dote 
for pron1 be seek by spirit of rich coat 
but keep cold distance and do thence remove 
to spend pron1 live in eternal love 
  but o pron1 sweet pron1 labour be not to leave 
the thing pron1 have not master pron1 not strive 
play the place which do no form receive 
play patient sport in unconstrained gyve 
pron1 that pron1 fame so to pron1 contrive 
the scar of battle iscapeth by the flight 
and make pron1 absence valiant not pron1 might 
  o pardon pron1 in that pron1 boast be true 
the accident which bring pron1 to pron1 eye 
upon the moment do pron1 force subdue 
and now pron1 would the cage cloister fly
