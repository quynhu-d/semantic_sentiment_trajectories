sometimes pron1 scud far off and there pron1 stare 
person1 pron1 start at stirring of a feather 
to bid the wind a base pron1 now prepare 
and where pron1 run or fly pron1 know not whether   ordinal1 
for through pron1 mane and tail the high wind sing 
fan the hair pron1 wave like person1 would wing 

pron1 look upon pron1 love and neigh unto pron1

be proud as female be to see pron1 woo pron1 
pron1 put on outward strangeness seem unkind 
spurn at pron1 love and scorn the heat pron1 feel 
beat pron1 kind embracement with pron1 heel   ordinal1 

then like a melancholy malcontent

cool shadow to pron1 melt buttock lend 
pron1 stamp and bite the poor fly in pron1 fume   person1 
pron1 love perceive how pron1 be enrag would

pron1 testy master person1 about to take pron1 
when pron1 the person1 would breeder full of fear ordinal1 
jealous of catch swiftly doth forsake pron1 
with pron1 the horse and leave adoni there 
as pron1 be mad unto the wood pron1 hie pron1 
outstrip crow pron1 strive to overfly pron1   ordinal1 

all swoln with chafing down adoni sit 
ban pron1 boisterous and unruly beast 
and now the happy season once more fit 
that love sick love by plead may be bl   ordinal1 
for lover say the heart hath treble wrong 
when pron1 be person1 would the aidance of the tongue 

an oven pron1 be stopp would or river stay would

so of conceal sorrow may be say 
free vent of word love be fire doth assuage 
but when the heart be attorney once be mute 
the client break as desperate in pron1 suit   ordinal1 

pron1 see pron1 come and begin to glow 
even as a die coal revive with wind 
and with pron1 bonnet hide pron1 angry brow 
look on the dull earth with disturbed mind ordinal1 
take no notice that pron1 be so nigh 
for all askance pron1 hold pron1 in pron1 eye 

o pron1 a sight pron1 be wistly to view 
how pron1 come steal to the wayward boy ordinal1 
to note the fight conflict of pron1 hue 
how white and person1 each other do destroy 
but now pron1 cheek be pale and by and by 
pron1 flash would forth fire as lightning from the sky   ordinal1 

now be pron1 just before pron1 as pron1 sit 
and like a lowly lover down pron1 kneel 
with ordinal1 fair hand pron1 heaveth up pron1 hat 
pron1 other tender hand pron1 fair cheek feel ordinal1 
pron1 tend arer cheek receive pron1 soft hand be print 
as apt as new fall n snow take any dint 

oh pron1 a war of look be then between pron1 
pron1 eye petitioner to pron1 eye sue ordinal1 
pron1 eye see pron1 eye as pron1 have not see pron1 
pron1 eye woo would still pron1 eye disdain would the wooing 
and all this dumb play have pron1 act make plain 
with tear which chorus like pron1 eye do rain 

full gently now pron1 take pron1 by the hand ordinal1 
a lily prison would in a gaol of snow 
or ivory in an alabaster band 
so white a friend engirt so white a foe ordinal1 
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling 
person1 would like ordinal1 silver dove pron1 sit a billing 

once more the engine of pron1 thought begin 
  o fairest mover on this mortal round ordinal1 
would pron1 wert as pron1 be and pron1 a man 
pron1 heart all whole as thine pron1 heart pron1 wound 
for ordinal1 sweet look pron1 help pron1 would assure pron1 
though pron1 but pron1 body be bane would cure pron1   

  give pron1 pron1 hand person1 pron1 why dost thou feel pron1   
  give pron1 pron1 heart person1 pron1 and thou shalt have pron1 
o give pron1 pron1 lest pron1 hard heart do steel pron1 
and be steel would soft sigh can never grave pron1   ordinal1 
then love be deep groan pron1 never shall regard 
because adoni heart hath make pron1 hard   

  for shame pron1 cry let go and let pron1 go 
pron1 day be delight be past pron1 horse be go ordinal1 
and notis pron1 fault pron1 be bereft pron1 so 
pron1 pray pron1 hence and leave pron1 here alone 
for all pron1 mind pron1 think pron1 busy care 
be how to get pron1 palfrey from the mare   ordinal1 

thus pron1 reply pron1 person1 as pron1 should 
welcome the warm approach of sweet desire 
affection be a coal pron1 must be cool would 
else suffer would pron1 will set the heart on fire ordinal1 
the sea hath bound but deep desire hath none 
therefore no marvel though pron1 horse be go 

  how like a jade pron1 stand tie to the tree 
servilely master would with a leathern rein   ordinal1 
but when pron1 see pron1 love pron1 youth be fair fee 
pron1 hold such petty bondage in disdain 
throw the base thong from pron1 bend crest 
enfranchise pron1 mouth pron1 back pron1 breast   ordinal1 

  pron1 see pron1 true love in pron1 naked bed 
teach the sheet a white hue than white 
but when pron1 glutton eye so full hath feed 
pron1 other agent aim at like delight   ordinal1 
pron1 be so faint pron1 dare not be so bold 
to touch the fire the weather be cold 

  let pron1 excuse pron1 courser gentle boy 
and learn of pron1 pron1 heartily beseech pron1 ordinal1 
to take advantage on present joy 
though pron1 be dumb yet pron1 proceeding teach pron1 
o learn to love the lesson be but plain 
and once make perfect never lose again   ordinal1 

  pron1 know not love quoth pron1 nor will not know pron1 
unless pron1 be a boar and then pron1 chase pron1 
  tis much to borrow and pron1 will not owe pron1 
pron1 love to love be love but to disgrace pron1   ordinal1 
for pron1 have hear pron1 be a life in death 
that laugh and weep and all but with a breath 

  pron1 wear a garment shapeless and unfinish would 
pron1 pluck the bud before ordinal1 leaf put forth   ordinal1 
if spring thing be any jot diminish would 
pron1 wither in pron1 prime prove pron1 worth 
the colt pron1 be back would and burden would be young 
person1 pron1 pride and never waxeth strong   ordinal1 

  pron1 hurt pron1 hand with wringing   let pron1 part 
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat 
remove pron1 siege from pron1 unyielde heart 
to love be alarm pron1 will not ope the gate ordinal1 
dismiss pron1 vow pron1 feign tear pron1 flatt ry 
for where a heart be hard pron1 make no batt ry   

  pron1   person1 thou talk   person1 pron1 hast thou a tongue 
o would thou hadst not or pron1 have no hearing   ordinal1 
thy mermaid be voice hath do pron1 double wrong 
pron1 have pron1 load before now press would with bear 
melodious discord heavenly tune harsh sounding 
ear be deep sweet music and heart be deep sore wounding 

  have pron1 no eye but ear pron1 ear would love ordinal1 
that inward beauty and invisible 
or be pron1 deaf pron1 outward part would move 
each part in pron1 pron1 be but sensible ordinal1 
though neither eye nor ear to hear nor see 
yet should pron1 be in love by touch pron1 

  say that the sense of feeling be bereft pron1 
and that pron1 could not see nor hear nor touch ordinal1 
and pron1 but the very smell be leave pron1 
yet would pron1 love to pron1 be still as much 
for from the stillitory of pron1 face excel 
come breath perfum would that breedeth love by smell 

  but oh what banquet wert thou to the taste ordinal1 
be nurse and feeder of the other ordinal1 
would pron1 not wish the feast might ever last 
and bid suspicion double lock the door 
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest 
should by pron1 stealing in disturb the feast   ordinal1 

once more the ruby colour would portal open would 
which to pron1 speech do honey passage yield ordinal1 
like a red morn pron1 ever yet betoken would 
wrack to the seaman tempest to the field 
sorrow to shepherd woe unto the bird 
gust and foul flaw to herdman and to herd   ordinal1 

this ill presage advisedly pron1 marketh 
even as the wind be hush would before pron1 person1 
or as the person1 person1 person1 before pron1 person1 
or as the berry break before pron1 person1 ordinal1 
or like the deadly bullet of a gun 
pron1 meaning strike pron1 ere pron1 word begin 

and at pron1 look pron1 flatly falleth down 
for look kill love and love by look reviveth   ordinal1 
a smile recur the wounding of a frown 
but bless bankrout that by person1 so person1 
the silly boy believe pron1 be dead 
claps pron1 pale cheek till clapping make pron1 red   ordinal1 

and all amaz would brake off pron1 late intent 
for sharply pron1 do think to reprehend pron1 
which cunning love do wittily prevent 
fair fall the wit pron1 can so well defend pron1   ordinal1 
for on the grass pron1 lie as pron1 be slay 
till pron1 breath breatheth life in pron1 again 

pron1 wring pron1 nose pron1 strike pron1 on the cheek 
pron1 bend pron1 finger hold pron1 pulse hard ordinal1 
pron1 chafe pron1 lip   a ordinal1 way pron1 seek 
to mend the hurt that pron1 unkindness person1 would 
pron1 kiss pron1   and pron1 by pron1 good will 
will never rise so pron1 will kiss pron1 still   ordinal1 

the night of sorrow now be turn would to day 
pron1 ordinal1 blue window faintly pron1 up person1 
like the fair sun when in pron1 fresh array 
pron1 cheer the morn and all the world person1 ordinal1 
and as the bright sun glorify the sky 
so be pron1 face person1 would with pron1 eye 

whose beam upon pron1 hairless face be fix would 
as if from thence pron1 borrow would all pron1 shine   ordinal1 
be never ordinal1 such lamp together mix would 
have not pron1 clouded with pron1 brow be repine 
but pron1 which through the crystal tear give light 
shone like the moon in water see by night   ordinal1 

  o where be pron1   person1 pron1 in earth or person1 
or in the ocean person1 would or in the fire 
what hour be this   or morn or weary even 
do pron1 delight to die or life desire   ordinal1 
but now pron1 person1 would and life be death be annoy 
but now pron1 die and death be lively joy 

  o person1 didst kill pron1   kill pron1 once again 
thy eye shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine ordinal1 
person1 teach pron1 scornful trick and such disdain 
that pron1 have murder would this poor heart of mine 
and these mine eye true leader to pron1 queen 
but for pron1 piteous lip no more have see   ordinal1 

  long may pron1 kiss each other for this cure 
oh never let pron1 crimson livery wear 
and as pron1 last pron1 verdure still endure 
to drive infection from the dangerous year ordinal1 
that the star gazer have writ on death 
may say the plague be banish would by pron1 breath 

  pure lip sweet seal in pron1 soft lip imprint 
pron1 bargain may pron1 make still to be seal   ordinal1 
to sell pron1 pron1 can be well content 
so pron1 wilt buy and pay and use good dealing 
which purchase if pron1 make for fear of slip 
set pron1 seal manual on pron1 wax red lip   ordinal1 

  a ordinal1 kiss buy pron1 heart from pron1 
and pay pron1 at pron1 leisure ordinal1 by ordinal1 
pron1 be ordinal1 ordinal1 touch unto pron1 
be pron1 not quickly tell and quickly go   ordinal1 
say for non payment pron1 the debt should double 
be ordinal1 ordinal1 kiss such a trouble   

  fair queen person1 pron1 if any love pron1 owe pron1 
measure pron1 strangeness with pron1 unripe year ordinal1 
before pron1 know pron1 seek not to know pron1 
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbear 
the mellow plum doth fall the green stick fast 
or be early pluck would be sour to taste   ordinal1 

  look the world be comforter with weary gait 
pron1 day be hot task hath end in the west 
the owl night be person1 shriek person1 very late 
the sheep be go to fold bird to pron1 nest ordinal1 
and coal black cloud pron1 shadow person1 be light 
do summon pron1 to part and bid good night 

  now let pron1 say good night and so say pron1 
if pron1 will say so pron1 shall have a kiss   ordinal1 
  good night quoth pron1   and ere pron1 say person1 
the honey fee of part tender would be 
pron1 arm do lend pron1 neck a sweet embrace 
incorporate then pron1 seem face grow to face   ordinal1 

till breathless pron1 disjoin would and backward draw 
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth 
whose precious taste pron1 thirsty lip well know 
person1 pron1 surfeit yet complain on drouth ordinal1 
pron1 with pron1 plenty press would pron1 faint with dearth 
pron1 lip together glue fall to the earth 

now quick desire hath catch the yield prey 
and glutton like pron1 feed yet never person1   ordinal1 
pron1 lip be conqueror pron1 lip obey 
pay pron1 ransom the insult willeth 
whose vulture think doth pitch the price so high 
that pron1 will draw pron1 lip rich treasure dry   ordinal1 

and have feel the sweetness of the spoil 
with blindfold fury pron1 begin to forage 
pron1 face doth reek and smoke pron1 blood doth boil 
and careless lust stir up a desperate courage ordinal1 
plant oblivion beat reason back

hot faint and weary with pron1 hard embrace 
like a wild bird be tam would with too much handling 
or as the fleet foot roe pron1 be person1 would with chase ordinal1 
or like the froward infant still would with dandle 
pron1 now obey and now no more person1 
while pron1 take all pron1 can not all pron1 listeth   ordinal1 

what wax so frozen but dissolve with temp ring 
and yield at last to every light impression 
thing out of hope be compass would oft with vent ring 
person1 in love whose leave exceed commission ordinal1 
affection faint not like a pale fac would coward 
but then woo good when most pron1 choice be froward 

when pron1 do frown o have pron1 then give over 
such nectar from pron1 lip pron1 have not suck would   ordinal1 
foul word and frown must not repel a lover 
pron1 though the rose have prickle yet notis pluck would 
be beauty under ordinal1 lock keep fast 
yet love break through and pick pron1 all at last 

for pity now pron1 can no more detain pron1   ordinal1 
the poor fool pray pron1 that pron1 may depart 
pron1 be resolv would no long to restrain pron1 
bid pron1 farewell and look well to pron1 heart ordinal1 
the which by cupid be bow pron1 doth protest 
pron1 carry thence encaged in pron1 breast 

  sweet boy pron1 say this night pron1 will waste in sorrow 
for pron1 sick heart command mine eye to watch   ordinal1

and on pron1 neck pron1 yoke arm pron1 throw   ordinal1 
pron1 sinketh down still hang by pron1 neck 
pron1 on pron1 belly fall pron1 on pron1 back 

now be pron1 in the very list of love 
pron1 champion mount for the hot encounter ordinal1 
all be imaginary pron1 doth prove 
pron1 will not manage pron1 although pron1 mount pron1 
that bad than tantalus be pron1 annoy 
to person1 elysium and to lack pron1 joy   ordinal1 

even as poor bird deceiv would with paint grape 
do surfeit by the eye and pine the person1 
even so pron1 person1 in pron1 mishap 
as those poor bird pron1 helpless berry see   ordinal1 
the warm effect which pron1 in pron1 find miss 
pron1 seek to kindle with continual kissing 

but all in vain person1 person1 pron1 will not be 
pron1 hath assay would as much as may be prov would   ordinal1 
pron1 pleading hath person1 would a great fee 
pron1 be love pron1 love and yet pron1 be not person1 would 
  person1 person1 pron1 say pron1 crush pron1   let pron1 go

  person1 hadst be go quoth pron1 sweet boy ere this 
but that person1 tell person1 pron1 thou wouldst hunt the boar 
oh be advis would   person1 know ist not pron1 pron1 be 
with person1 be point a churlish swine to person1 ordinal1 
pron1 tush never sheath would pron1 person1 still 
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill 

  on pron1 bow back pron1 hath a battle set 
of bristly pike pron1 ever threat pron1 foe   ordinal1 
pron1 eye like glow worm shine when pron1 doth fret 
pron1 snout dig sepulchre where er pron1 go 
be mov would pron1 strike person1 er be in pron1 way 
and pron1 pron1 strike pron1 crooked person1 slay   ordinal1 

  pron1 brawny side with hairy bristle arm 
be well proof than pron1 spear be point can enter 
pron1 short thick neck can not be easily harm 
be ireful on the lion pron1 will venture ordinal1 
the thorny bramble and embrace bush 
as fearful of pron1 part through pron1 pron1 rush 

  alas   pron1 naught esteem that face of thine 
to which love be eye pay tributary gaze   ordinal1 
nor pron1 soft hand sweet lip and person1 person1 
whose full perfection all the world amaze 
but have pron1 at vantage wondrous dread 
would root these beauty as pron1 root the mead 

  oh let pron1 keep pron1 loathsome cabin still ordinal1 
beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiend 
come not within pron1 danger by pron1 will 
pron1 pron1 thrive well take counsel of pron1 friend 
when pron1 didst name the boar not to dissemble 
pron1 fear would thy fortune and pron1 joint do tremble 

  didst person1 not mark pron1 face be pron1 not white 
see ist thou not sign of fear lurk in mine eye   ordinal1 
grew pron1 not faint and fall pron1 not downright 
within pron1 bosom whereon person1 dost lie 
pron1 bode heart pant beat and take no rest 
but like an earthquake shake pron1 on pron1 breast 

  for where love reign disturb jealousy ordinal1 
person1 call pron1 affection be sentinel 
give false alarm suggesteth mutiny 
and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill   ordinal1 
person1 ring gentle love in pron1 desire 
as air and water do abate the fire 

  this sour informer this bate breeding spy 
this canker pron1 eat up love be tender spring ordinal1 
this carry tale dissentious jealousy 
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring 
knock at pron1 heart and whisper in mine ear 
that if pron1 love pron1 pron1 pron1 death should fear   ordinal1 

  and more than so person1 to mine eye 
the picture of an angry chafing boar 
under whose sharp fang on pron1 back person1 lie 
an image like pron1 all stain would with person1   ordinal1 
whose blood upon the fresh flower be shed 
person1 make pron1 droop with grief and hang the head 

  pron1 should pron1 do see pron1 so indeed 
that tremble at th imagination   ordinal1 
the thought of pron1 doth make pron1 faint heart bleed 
and fear person1 teach pron1 divination 
pron1 prophesy pron1 death pron1 live sorrow 
if pron1 encounter with the boar tomorrow   ordinal1 

  but if person1 need wilt hunt be rul would by pron1 
uncouple at the timorous fly hare 
or at the fox which live by person1 
or at the roe which no encounter dare ordinal1 
pursue these fearful creature o er the down 
and on pron1 well breath would horse keep with pron1 hound 

  and when person1 hast on foot the purblind hare 
person1 the poor wretch to overshoot pron1 trouble ordinal1 
how pron1 outrun the wind and with pron1 care 
pron1 crank and crosse with a ordinal1 double 
the many musit through the which pron1 go 
be like a labyrinth to amaze pron1 foe   ordinal1 

  sometime pron1 run among a flock of sheep 
to make the cunning hound mistake pron1 smell 
and sometime where earth delve cony keep 
to stop the loud pursuer in pron1 yell ordinal1 
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer 
danger deviseth shift wit wait on fear 

  for there pron1 smell with other be mingle ordinal1 
the hot scent snuff hound be drive to doubt 
cease pron1 clamorous cry till pron1 have single 
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out 
then do pron1 spend pron1 mouth echo reply 
as if another chase be in the sky   ordinal1 

  by this poor wat far off upon a hill 
stand on pron1 hinder leg with list ning ear 
to hearken if pron1 foe pursue pron1 still 
person1 pron1 loud alarum pron1 doth hear   ordinal1 
and now pron1 grief may be compare well 
to ordinal1 sore sick pron1 hear the pass bell 

  then shalt person1 see the dew bedabbled wretch 
turn and return indent with the way ordinal1 
each envious briar pron1 weary leg do scratch 
each shadow make pron1 stop each murmur stay 
for misery be trodden on by many 
and be low never reliev would by any   ordinal1 

  lie quietly and hear a little more 
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise 
to make pron1 hate the hunting of the boar 
unlike pron1 thou hear ist pron1 moralize ordinal1 
apply this to that and so to so 
for love can comment upon every woe 

  where do pron1 leave   no matter where quoth pron1 
  leave pron1 and then the story aptly end ordinal1 
the night be spend   why pron1 of that   person1 pron1 
  pron1 be quoth pron1 expect of pron1 friend 
and now notis dark and go pron1 shall fall   
  in night person1 pron1 desire see good of all   ordinal1 

but if pron1 fall oh then imagine this 
the earth in love with pron1 pron1 footing trip 
and all be but to rob pron1 of a kiss   ordinal1 
person1 prey make true man thief   so do pron1 lip 
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn 
lest pron1 should steal a kiss and die forsworn   

  now of this dark night pron1 perceive the reason 
person1 for shame obscure pron1 silver shine ordinal1 
till forge nature be condemn would of treason 
for steal mould from person1 pron1 be divine 
wherein pron1 fram would thee in high person1 be despite 
to shame the sun by day and pron1 by night   ordinal1 

  and therefore hath pron1 brib would the destiny 
to cross the curious workmanship of nature 
to mingle beauty with infirmity 
and pure perfection with impure defeature ordinal1 
make pron1 subject to the tyranny 
of mad mischance and much misery 

  as burn fever ague pale and faint 
life poisoning pestilence and frenzy wood ordinal1 
the marrow eat sickness whose attaint 
disorder breed by heating of the blood 
person1 imposthume grief and damn would despair 
swear nature be death for frame pron1 so fair   ordinal1 

  and not the least of all these malady 
but in ordinal1 minute be fight bring beauty under 
both favour savour hue and quality 
person1 person1 impartial gazer late do wonder ordinal1 
be on the sudden waste thaw would and do 
as mountain snow melt with the midday sun 

  therefore despite of fruitless chastity 
love lack vestal and self love nun ordinal1 
that on the earth would breed a scarcity 
and barren dearth of daughter and of son 
be prodigal the lamp pron1 burn by night 
dry up pron1 oil to lend the world pron1 light   ordinal1 

  pron1 be pron1 body but a swallow grave 
seem to bury that posterity 
which by the right of time thou need must have 
if pron1 destroy pron1 not in dark obscurity   ordinal1 
if so the world will hold pron1 in disdain 
person1 in thy pride so fair a hope be slay 

  so in pron1 pron1 art make away 
a mischief bad than civil home breed strife ordinal1 
or pron1 whose desperate hand pron1 do slay 
or butcher sire pron1 reeve pron1 son of life 
foul person1 ring rust the hide treasure fret 
but gold pron1 be put to use more gold beget   ordinal1 

  person1 then quoth adon pron1 will fall again 
into pron1 idle over handle theme 
the kiss pron1 give pron1 be bestow would in vain 
and all in vain pron1 strive against the stream   ordinal1 
for by this black fac would night desire be foul nurse 
pron1 treatise make pron1 like pron1 bad and bad 

  if love have lend pron1 ordinal1 ordinal1 tongue 
and every tongue more move than pron1 own ordinal1 
bewitch like the wanton mermaid be song 
yet from mine ear the tempting tune be blow 
for know pron1 heart stand armed in mine ear 
and will not let a false sound enter there   ordinal1 

  lest the deceive harmony should run 
into the quiet closure of pron1 breast 
and then pron1 little heart be quite undone 
in pron1 bedchamber to be person1 would of rest   ordinal1 
no lady no   pron1 heart long not to groan 
but soundly sleep while now pron1 sleep alone 

  pron1 have pron1 person1 would that pron1 can not reprove 
the path be smooth that leadeth on to danger   ordinal1 
pron1 hate not love but pron1 device in love 
that lend embracement unto every stranger 
pron1 do pron1 for increase o strange excuse 
when reason be the bawd to lust be abuse   ordinal1 

  call pron1 not love for love to person1 be flee 
since sweat lust on earth usurp would pron1 name 
under whose simple semblance pron1 hath feed 
upon fresh beauty blot pron1 with blame   ordinal1 
which the hot tyrant stain and soon bereave 
as caterpillar do the tender leave 

  love person1 like sunshine after rain 
but lust be effect be tempest after sun   ordinal1 
love be gentle spring doth always fresh remain 
person1 be winter come ere summer half be do 
love surfeit not lust like a glutton die 
love be all truth lust full of forge lie   ordinal1 

  more pron1 could tell but more pron1 dare not say 
the text be old the orator too green 
therefore in sadness now pron1 will away 
pron1 face be full of shame pron1 heart of teen ordinal1 
mine ear that to pron1 wanton talk attend 
do burn pron1 for have so offended   

with this pron1 breaketh from the sweet embrace ordinal1 
of those fair arm which bind pron1 to pron1 breast 
and homeward through the dark person1 run apace 
leave love upon pron1 back deeply distress would 
look how a bright star person1 from the sky 
so glide pron1 in the night from person1 eye   ordinal1 

which after pron1 pron1 dart as ordinal1 on shore 
gaze upon a late embark friend 
till the wild wave will have pron1 see no more 
pron1 ridge with the meeting cloud contend ordinal1 
so do the merciless and pitchy night 
fold in the object pron1 do feed pron1 sight 

person1 person1 would as one pron1 unaware 
person1 person1 would a precious jewel in the flood ordinal1 
or istonish would as night wanderer often be 
pron1 light blow out in some mistrustful wood 
even so confound in the dark pron1 lie 
have lose the fair discovery of pron1 way   ordinal1 

and now pron1 beat pron1 heart person1 pron1 groan 
that all the neighbour cave as seem troubled 
make verbal repetition of pron1 moan 
passion on passion deeply be redouble ordinal1 
  ay pron1   pron1 cry and ordinal1 time woe woe   
and ordinal1 echo ordinal1 time cry so 

pron1 mark pron1 begin a wail note 
and sing extemporally a woeful ditty   ordinal1 
how love make young man thrall and old man dote 
how love be wise in folly foolish witty 
pron1 heavy anthem still conclude in woe 
and still the choir of echo answer so   ordinal1 

pron1 song be tedious and outwore the night 
for lover hour be long though seem short 
if plea would pron1 other pron1 think delight 
in such like circumstance with such like sport ordinal1 
pron1 copious story oftentime begin 
end without audience and be never do 

for pron1 hath pron1 to spend the night withal 
but idle sound resemble parasite   ordinal1 
like shrill tongu would tapster answer every call 
soothe the humour of fantastic wit 
pron1 say tis so pron1 answer all tis so   
and would say after pron1 if pron1 say no   ordinal1 

person1 here the gentle lark weary of rest 
from pron1 moist cabinet mount up on high 
and wake the morning from whose silver breast 
the sun ariseth in pron1 majesty   ordinal1 
pron1 doth the world so gloriously behold 
that cedar top and hill seem burnish would gold 

person1 salute pron1 with this fair good morrow 
  oh pron1 clear person1 and patron of all light ordinal1 
from pron1 each lamp and shine star person1 borrow 
the beauteous influence pron1 make pron1 bright 
pron1 live a son pron1 suck would an earthly mother 
may lend pron1 light as thou pron1 lend to other   

this say pron1 person1 to a myrtle grove ordinal1 
muse the morning be so much o erworn 
and yet pron1 hear no tiding of pron1 love 
pron1 hearken for pron1 hound and for pron1 horn   ordinal1 
person1 pron1 hear pron1 chant pron1 lustily 
and all in haste pron1 person1 to the cry 

and as pron1 run the bush in the way 
some catch pron1 by the neck some kiss pron1 face ordinal1 
some twine about pron1 thigh to make pron1 stay 
pron1 wildly breaketh from pron1 strict embrace 
like a milch doe whose swell dug do ache 
haste to feed pron1 fawn hide in some brake   ordinal1 

by this pron1 hear the hound be at a bay 
person1 pron1 start like ordinal1 pron1 spy an adder 
wreath would up in fatal fold just in pron1 way 
the fear whereof doth make pron1 shake and shudder   ordinal1 
even so the timorous yelping of the hound 
appal pron1 sense and pron1 spirit confound 

for now pron1 know pron1 be no gentle chase 
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud ordinal1 
because the cry remaineth in ordinal1 place 
where fearfully the dog exclaim aloud 
find pron1 enemy to be so person1 
pron1 all strain court isy pron1 shall cope pron1 first   person1 

this dismal cry ring sadly in pron1 ear 
through which pron1 enter to surprise pron1 heart 
pron1 overcome by doubt and bloodless fear 
with cold pale weakness numb each feel part   ordinal1 
like soldier when pron1 captain once doth yield 
pron1 basely fly and dare not stay the field 

thus stand pron1 in a tremble ecstasy 
till cheer up pron1 sense sore dismay would ordinal1 
pron1 tell pron1 notis a causeless fantasy 
and childish error that pron1 be afraid 
bid pron1 leave quake bid pron1 fear no more 
and with that word pron1 spy the hunted boar   ordinal1 

whose frothy mouth bepainte all with red 
like milk and blood be mingle both together 
a second fear through all pron1 sinew spread 
which madly hurry pron1 pron1 know not whither ordinal1 
this way pron1 run and now pron1 will no far 
but back retire to rate the boar for person1 

a ordinal1 spleen bear pron1 a ordinal1 way 
pron1 tread the path pron1 pron1 untread again   ordinal1 
pron1 more than haste be mate with delay 
like the proceeding of a drunken brain 
full of respect yet naught at all respect 
in hand with all thing naught at all effect 

here person1 would in a brake pron1 find a hound ordinal1 
and ask the weary caitiff for pron1 master 
and pron1 another licking of pron1 wound 
  gainst venom would sore the only sovereign plaster   ordinal1 
and here pron1 meet another sadly scowl 
to pron1 pron1 speak and pron1 reply with howl 

when pron1 hath person1 would pron1 ill resounding noise 
another flap mouth would mourner black and grim ordinal1 
against the person1 person1 out pron1 voice 
another and another answer pron1 
clap pron1 proud tail to the ground below 
shake pron1 scratch would ear bleed as pron1 go 

look how the world be poor people be amazed ordinal1 
at apparition sign and prodigy 
person1 with fearful eye pron1 long have gaze 
infuse pron1 with dreadful prophecy   ordinal1 
so pron1 at these sad sign draw up pron1 breath 
and sigh pron1 again exclaim on death 

  hard favour would tyrant ugly meagre lean ordinal1 
hateful divorce of love thus chide pron1 death 
  grim grin ghost earth be worm pron1 dost thou mean 
to stifle beauty and to steal pron1 breath 
pron1 when pron1 person1 would pron1 breath and beauty set 
gloss on the rose smell to the violet   ordinal1 

  if pron1 be dead o no pron1 can not be 
see pron1 beauty thou shouldst strike at pron1 
o yes pron1 may person1 hast no eye to see 
but hatefully at random person1 person1 hit   ordinal1 
thy mark be feeble age but pron1 false dart 
mistake pron1 aim and cleave an infant be heart 

  hadst thou but bid beware then pron1 have speak 
and hear pron1 pron1 power have lose pron1 power   ordinal1 
the destiny will curse pron1 for this stroke 
pron1 bid pron1 crop a weed thou pluck ist a flower 
love be golden arrow at pron1 should have flee 
and not death be ebon dart to strike pron1 dead   ordinal1 

  dost thou drink tear pron1 person1 person1 person1 such weeping 
pron1 may a heavy groan advantage pron1 
why person1 person1 cast into eternal sleeping 
those eye pron1 teach all other eye to see   ordinal1 
now nature care not for pron1 mortal vigour 
since pron1 good work be ruin would with person1 rigour   

here overcome as ordinal1 full of despair 
pron1 vail would pron1 eyelid pron1 like sluice person1 would ordinal1 
the crystal tide that from pron1 ordinal1 cheek fair 
in the sweet channel of pron1 bosom dropp would 
but through the flood gate break the silver rain 
and with pron1 strong course open pron1 again   ordinal1 

o how pron1 eye and tear do lend and borrow 
pron1 eye see in the tear tear in pron1 eye 
both crystal where pron1 view would each other be sorrow 
sorrow that friendly sigh seek still to dry   ordinal1 
but like a stormy day now wind now rain 
sigh dry pron1 cheek tear make pron1 wet again 

variable passion throng pron1 constant woe 
as strive pron1 should well become pron1 grief   ordinal1 
all entertain would each passion labour so 
that every present sorrow person1 chief 
but none be good then join pron1 all together 
like many cloud consult for foul weather   ordinal1 

by this far off pron1 hear some huntsman holla 
a nurse be song ne er plea would pron1 babe so well 
the dire imagination pron1 do follow 
this sound of hope doth labour to expel   ordinal1 
for now revive joy bid pron1 rejoice 
and flatter pron1 pron1 be adonis voice 

person1 pron1 tear begin to turn pron1 tide 
be prison would in pron1 eye like pearl in glass   ordinal1 
yet sometimes fall an orient drop beside 
which pron1 cheek melt as scorn pron1 should pass 
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground 
pron1 be but drunken when pron1 seemeth drown would 

o hard believe love how strange pron1 seem ordinal1 
not to believe and yet too credulous 
thy weal and woe be both of pron1 extreme 
despair and hope make pron1 ridiculous ordinal1 
the one doth flatter pron1 in thought unlikely 
in likely thought the other kill pron1 quickly 

now pron1 unweave the web pron1 pron1 hath work 
person1 live and death be not to blame   ordinal1 
pron1 be not pron1 that call would pron1 all to naught 
now pron1 add honour to pron1 hateful name 
pron1 clepe pron1 king of grave and grave for king 
imperious supreme of all mortal thing   ordinal1 

  no no quoth pron1 sweet death pron1 do but jest 
yet pardon pron1 pron1 feel a kind of fear 
person1 pron1 meet the boar that bloody beast 
which know no pity but be still severe   ordinal1 
then gentle shadow truth pron1 must confess 
pron1 rail would on pron1 fear pron1 love be decease 

  tis not pron1 fault the person1 person1 would pron1 tongue 
be wreak would on pron1 invisible commander   ordinal1 
  tis pron1 foul creature pron1 hath do pron1 wrong 
pron1 do but act pron1 be author of pron1 slander 
grief hath ordinal1 tongue and never woman yet 
could rule pron1 both without ordinal1 woman be wit   

thus hope that adoni be alive ordinal1 
pron1 rash suspect pron1 doth extenuate 
and that pron1 beauty may the well thrive 
with death pron1 humbly doth insinuate   ordinal1 
tell pron1 of trophy statue tomb and story 
pron1 victory pron1 triumph and pron1 glory 

  o love   person1 pron1 how much a fool be pron1 
to be of such a weak and silly mind ordinal1 
to wail pron1 death pron1 live and must not die 
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind 
for pron1 be dead with pron1 be beauty slay 
and beauty dead black chaos come again   ordinal1 

  person1 person1 person1 person1 person1 art as full of fear 
as ordinal1 with treasure person1 person1 would with thief 
trifle unwitnesse with eye or ear 
thy coward heart with false bethinking grief   ordinal1 
even at this word pron1 hear a merry horn 
person1 pron1 leap that be but late forlorn 

as falcon to the lure away pron1 fly 
the grass stoop not pron1 tread on pron1 so light ordinal1 
and in pron1 haste unfortunately spy 
the foul boar be conquest on pron1 fair delight 
which see pron1 eye as murder would with the view 
like star asham would of day pron1 withdraw 

or as the snail whose tender horn be hit ordinal1 
shrink backwards in pron1 shelly cave with pain 
and pron1 all smother would up in shade doth sit 
long after fear to creep forth again ordinal1 
so at pron1 bloody view pron1 eye be flee 
into the deep dark cabin of pron1 head 

where pron1 resign pron1 office and pron1 light 
to the disposing of pron1 troubled brain ordinal1 
pron1 bid pron1 still consort with ugly night 
and never wound the heart with look again 
pron1 like a king perplex in pron1 throne 
by pron1 suggestion give a deadly groan   ordinal1 

person1 each tributary subject quake 
as when the wind imprison would in the ground 
struggle for passage earth be foundation shake 
which with cold terror doth man be mind confound 
this mutiny each part doth so surprise ordinal1 
that from pron1 dark bed once more leap pron1 eye 

and be open would throw unwilling light 
upon the wide wound pron1 the boar have trench would 
in pron1 soft flank whose wonte lily white ordinal1 
with purple tear that pron1 wound weep be person1 would 
no flower be nigh no grass herb leaf or weed 
but steal pron1 blood and seem would with pron1 to bleed 

this solemn sympathy poor person1 person1 ordinal1 
over ordinal1 shoulder doth pron1 hang pron1 head 
dumbly pron1 passion franticly pron1 person1 
pron1 think pron1 could not die pron1 be not dead ordinal1 
pron1 voice be person1 would pron1 joint forget to bow 
pron1 eye be mad that pron1 have weep till now 

upon pron1 hurt pron1 look so steadfastly 
that pron1 sight dazzling make the wound seem ordinal1 
and then pron1 reprehend pron1 mangle eye ordinal1 
that make more gash where no breach should be 
pron1 face seem twain each several limb be double 
for oft the eye mistake the brain be troubled 

  pron1 tongue can not express pron1 grief for ordinal1 ordinal1 
and yet quoth pron1 behold ordinal1 adon dead 
pron1 sigh be blow away pron1 salt tear go 
mine eye be turn would to fire pron1 heart to lead ordinal1 
heavy heart be lead melt at mine eye red fire 
so shall pron1 die by drop of hot desire 

  alas poor world what treasure hast person1 lose 
pron1 face remain alive pron1 be worth the viewing 
whose tongue be music now   pron1 canst thou boast 
of thing long since or pron1 ensue   ordinal1 
the flower be sweet pron1 colour fresh and trim 
but true sweet beauty person1 would and die with pron1 

  bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear   ordinal1 
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss pron1 
have no fair to lose pron1 need not fear 
the sun doth scorn pron1 and the wind doth hiss pron1 
but when person1 person1 would sun and sharp air ordinal1 
lurk would like ordinal1 thief to rob pron1 of pron1 fair 

  and therefore would pron1 put pron1 bonnet on 
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep   ordinal1 
the wind would blow pron1 off and be go 
play with pron1 lock   then would adoni weep 
and straight in pity of pron1 tender year 
pron1 both would strive pron1 first should dry pron1 tear 

  to see pron1 face the lion walk would along ordinal1 
behind some hedge because pron1 would not fear pron1 
to recreate pron1 when pron1 hath sing 
the tiger would be tame and gently hear pron1   ordinal1 
if pron1 have speak the wolf would leave pron1 prey 
and never fright the silly lamb that day 

  when pron1 behold pron1 shadow in the person1 
the fish spread on pron1 pron1 golden gill   ordinal1 
when pron1 be by the bird such pleasure take 
that some would sing some other in pron1 bill 
would bring pron1 mulberry and ripe red cherry 
pron1 feed pron1 with pron1 sight pron1 pron1 with berry 

  but this foul grim and urchin snoute boar ordinal1 
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave 
person1 er see the beauteous livery pron1 pron1 wear 
witness the entertainment pron1 pron1 give   ordinal1 
if pron1 do see pron1 face why then pron1 know 
pron1 think to kiss pron1 and hath kill would pron1 so 

  tis true notis true   thus be adoni slay 
pron1 run upon the boar with pron1 sharp spear ordinal1 
pron1 do not whet pron1 tooth at pron1 again 
but by a kiss think to persuade pron1 there 
and nuzzling in pron1 flank the love swine 
person1 would unaware the tusk in pron1 soft groin   ordinal1 

  have pron1 be tooth would like pron1 pron1 must confess 
with kiss pron1 pron1 should have kill would pron1 first 
but pron1 be dead and never do pron1 bless 
pron1 youth with pron1   the more be pron1 accurst   ordinal1 
with this pron1 falleth in the place pron1 stand 
and stain pron1 face with pron1 congeal blood 

pron1 look upon pron1 lip and pron1 be pale 
pron1 take pron1 by the hand and that be cold ordinal1 
pron1 whisper in pron1 ear a heavy tale 
as if pron1 hear the woeful word pron1 tell 
pron1 lift the coffer lid pron1 close pron1 eye 
where person1 ordinal1 lamp burn out in darkness lie 

ordinal1 glass where pron1 pron1 behold ordinal1 
a ordinal1 time and now no more reflect 
pron1 virtue lose wherein pron1 late excell would 
and every beauty robb would of pron1 effect   ordinal1 
  wonder of time quoth pron1 this be pron1 spite 
that thou be dead the day should yet be light 

  since person1 art dead person1 here pron1 prophesy 
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend ordinal1 
pron1 shall be wait on with jealousy 
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end 
person1 er settle equally but high or low 
that all love be pleasure shall not match pron1 woe 

  pron1 shall be fickle false and full of fraud ordinal1 
person1 and be blast in a breathing while 
the bottom poison and the top o erstraw would 
with sweet pron1 shall the true sight beguile   ordinal1 
the strong body shall pron1 make most weak 
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak 

  pron1 shall be spare and too full of riot 
teach decrepit age to tread the measure   ordinal1 
the stare ruffian shall pron1 keep in quiet 
pluck down the person1 enrich the poor with treasure 
pron1 shall be rage mad and silly mild 
make the young old the old become a child   ordinal1 

  pron1 shall suspect where be no cause of fear 
pron1 shall not fear where pron1 should most mistrust 
pron1 shall be merciful and too severe 
and most deceiving when pron1 seem most just   ordinal1 
perverse pron1 shall be where pron1 show most toward 
put fear to valour courage to the coward 

  pron1 shall be cause of war and dire event 
and set dissension person1 the son and sire   ordinal1 
subject and servile to all discontent 
as dry combustious matter be to fire 
person1 in pron1 prime death doth pron1 love destroy 
pron1 pron1 love well pron1 love shall not enjoy   ordinal1 

by this the boy pron1 by pron1 side lie kill would 
be melt like a vapour from pron1 sight 
and in pron1 blood that on the ground lay spill would 
a purple flower spring up chequer would with white ordinal1 
resemble well pron1 pale cheek and the blood 
which in round drop upon pron1 whiteness stand 

pron1 bow pron1 head the new sprung flower to smell 
compare pron1 to pron1 adonis breath   ordinal1 
and say within pron1 bosom pron1 shall dwell 
since pron1 pron1 be reft from pron1 by death 
pron1 crop the stalk and in the breach appear 
green drop sap which pron1 compare to tear 

  poor flower quoth pron1 this be pron1 father be guise 
sweet issue of a more sweet smell sire 
for every little grief to wet pron1 eye 
to grow unto pron1 be pron1 desire ordinal1 
and so notis thine   but know pron1 be as good 
to wither in pron1 breast as in pron1 blood 

  here be pron1 father be bed here in pron1 breast 
thou art the next of blood and notis person1 right ordinal1 
person1 in this hollow cradle take pron1 rest 
pron1 throbbing heart shall rock person1 day and night 
pron1 shall not be ordinal1 minute in an hour 
wherein pron1 will not kiss pron1 sweet love be flower   

thus weary of the world away pron1 hie ordinal1 
and yoke pron1 silver dove   by whose swift aid 
pron1 mistress mount through the empty sky 
in pron1 light chariot quickly be convey would   ordinal1 
hold pron1 course to paphos where pron1 queen 
mean to immure pron1 and not be see
