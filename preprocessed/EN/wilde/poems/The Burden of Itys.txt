the burden of itys 
this english thame be holier far than person1 
those harebell like a sudden flush of sea 
break across the woodland with the foam 
of meadow sweet and white anemone 
to fleck pron1 blue wave person1 be likeli there 
than hide in that crystal hearted star the pale monk bear 

those violet gleam butterfly pron1 take 
person1 creamy lily for pron1 pavilion 
be person1 and where the rush shake 
a lazy pike lie bask in the sun 
pron1 eye half shut pron1 be some mitred old 
person1 in person1   look at those gaudy scale all green and gold 

the wind the restless prisoner of the tree 
do well for person1 pron1 would say 
the mighty master be hand be on the key 
of the person1 person1 which pron1 play 
when early on some sapphire easter morn 
in a high litter red as blood or sin the person1 be bear 

from pron1 dark house out to the balcony 
above the bronze gate and the crowded square 
whose very fountain seem for ecstasy 
to toss pron1 silver lance in the air 
and stretch out weak hand to person1 and west 
in vain send peace to person1 land to restless nation rest 

be not person1 linger orange after glow 
that stay to vex the moon more fair than all 
person1 be lordly pageant   strange a year ago 
pron1 knelt before some crimson cardinal 
pron1 bare the host across the person1 
and now those common poppy in the wheat seem twice as fine 

the blue green person1 yonder tremulous 
with the last shower sweet perfume bring 
through this cool evening than the odorous 
flame jewel censer the young deacon swing 
when the grey priest unlock the curtained shrine 
and make person1 be body from the common fruit of corn and vine 

poor fra person1 bawl at the mass 
be out of tune now for a small brown bird 
sing overhead and through the long cool grass 
pron1 see that throbbing throat which once pron1 hear 
on starlit hill of flower star arcady 
once where the white and person1 sand of person1 meet sea 

person1 be the swallow twittering on the eave 
at daybreak when the mower whet pron1 scythe 
and stock dove person1 and the milkmaid leave 
pron1 little lonely bed and carol person1 
to see the heavy lowing cattle wait 
stretch pron1 huge and dripping mouth across the farmyard gate 

and sweet the hop upon the kentish leas 
and sweet the wind pron1 lift the new mown hay 
and sweet the fretful swarm of grumble bee 
that round and round the person1 blossom play 
and sweet the heifer breathing in the stall 
and the green burst fig pron1 hang upon the red brick wall 

and sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring 
while the last violet loiter by the well 
and sweet to hear the shepherd daphnis sing 
the song of linus through a sunny person1 
of warm arcadia where the corn be gold 
and the slight lithe limbe reaper dance about the wattle fold 

and sweet with young lycoris to recline 
in some illyrian valley far away 
where canopy on herb person1 
pron1 too might waste the summer trancèd day 
match pron1 reed in sportive rivalry 
while far beneath pron1 fret the troubled purple of the sea 

but sweet far if silver person1 foot 
of some long hide person1 should ever tread 
the person1 meadow if with reeded flute 
press to pron1 lip some faun might raise pron1 head 
by the green water flag ah   person1 indeed 
to see the heavenly herdsman call pron1 white fleece flock to feed 

then sing to pron1 thou tuneful chorister 
though pron1 sing ist be thine own requiem 
tell pron1 pron1 tale person1 hapless chronicler 
of thine own tragedy   do not contemn 
these unfamiliar haunt this english field 
for many a lovely coronal pron1 northern isle can yield 

which grecian meadow know not many a rose 
which all day long in vale person1 
a lad might seek in vain for over grow 
pron1 hedge like a wanton courtesan 
person1 of pron1 beauty   lily too 
person1 never mirror star pron1 stream and cockle blue 

dot the green wheat which though pron1 be the sign 
for swallow go south would never spread 
pron1 azure tent between the attic vine 
even that little weed of ragged red 
which bid the robin pipe in arcady 
would be a trespasser and many an unsung elegy 

sleep in the reed pron1 fringe pron1 wind thame 
which to awake be sweet ravishment 
than ever person1 weep for   diadem 
of brown bee stud orchid which be mean 
for person1 be brow be hide here 
unknown to cytheræa and by yonder pasturing steer 

pron1 be a tiny yellow daffodil 
the butterfly can see pron1 from afar 
although ordinal1 summer evening be dew could fill 
pron1 little cup twice over ere the star 
have call the lazy shepherd to pron1 fold 
and be no prodigal   each leaf be fleck with spot gold 

as if person1 be gorgeous person1 person1 
hot from pron1 gilded arm have stoop to kiss 
the tremble petal or young mercury 
low fly to the person1 person1 of person1 
have with ordinal1 feather of pron1 pinion 
just brush pron1   the slight stem which bear the burden of pron1 sun 

be hardly thick than the gossamer 
or poor person1 be silver tapestry 
man say pron1 bloom upon the sepulchre 
of ordinal1 pron1 sometime worship but to pron1 
pron1 seem to bring diviner memory 
of faun love person1 glade and blue nymph haunt sea 

of an untrodden vale at tempe where 
on the clear river be marge narcissus lie 
the tangle of the forest in pron1 hair 
the silence of the woodland in pron1 eye 
woo that drift imagery which be 
no soon kiss than broken   person1 of person1 

pron1 be not boy nor girl and yet be both 
person1 by ordinal1 fire and unsatisfied 
through pron1 excess each passion be loth 
for love be own sake to leave the other be side 
yet kill love by stay   memory 
of oread peep through the leave of silent moonlit tree 

of lonely ariadne on the wharf 
at person1 when pron1 see the treacherous crew 
far out at sea and wave pron1 crimson scarf 
and call false theseus back again nor know 
that dionyso on an person1 person1 
be close behind pron1   memory of pron1 person1 be person1 

with sightless eye behold the wall of person1 
person1 person1 lie in the ivory room 
and at pron1 side an amorous red lipped boy 
trim with dainty hand pron1 helmet be plume 
and far away the moil the shout the groan 
as hector shield off the spear and ajax hurl the stone 

of wingèd perseus with pron1 flawless sword 
cleave the snaky tress of the witch 
and all those tale imperishably store 
in little grecian urn freightage more rich 
than any gaudy galleon of person1 
bare from the indie ever   these at least bring back again 

for well pron1 know pron1 be not dead at all 
the ancient god of person1 person1 
pron1 be asleep and when pron1 hear pron1 call 
will wake and think not be very thessaly 
this thame the daulian water this person1 glade 
the yellow irised mead where once young itys laugh and play 

if pron1 be thou dear person1 cradle bird 
pron1 from the leafy stillness of pron1 throne 
person1 to the wondrous boy until pron1 hear 
the horn of person1 faintly blow 
across the cumnor hill and wander 
through bagley wood at evening find the attic poet spring 

ah   tiny sober suited advocate 
that plead for the moon against the day 
if pron1 didst make the shepherd seek pron1 mate 
on that sweet questing when proserpina 
forget pron1 be not sicily and leant 
across the mossy sandford stile in ravished wonderment 

light winged and bright eyed miracle of the wood 
if ever thou didst person1 with melody 
ordinal1 of that little clan pron1 brotherhood 
which love the morning star of tuscany 
more than the perfect sun of person1 
and be immortal sing to pron1   for pron1 too love pron1 well 

sing on   sing on   let the dull world grow young 
let elemental thing take form again 
and the old shape of beauty walk among 
the simple garth and open croft as when 
the son of person1 person1 the willow rod 
and the soft sheep and shaggy goat follow the boyish person1 

sing on   sing on   and person1 will be here 
astride upon pron1 gorgeous indian throne 
and over whimper tiger shake the spear 
with yellow ivy crown and gummy cone 
while at pron1 side the wanton bassarid 
will throw the lion by the person1 and catch the mountain kid 

sing on   and pron1 will wear the leopard skin 
and steal the moonèd wing of ashtaroth 
upon whose icy chariot pron1 could win 
person1 in an hour ere the froth 
have over brim the wine vat or the faun 
cease from the treading   ay before the flicker lamp of dawn 

have scare the hoot owlet to pron1 nest 
and warn the bat to close pron1 filmy van 
some mænad girl with vine leave on pron1 breast 
will filch pron1 beech nut from the sleeping pan 
so softly that the little nested thrush 
will never wake and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush 

down the person1 person1 where the fall person1 
lie thick beneath the elm and count pron1 store 
till the brown satyr in a jolly crew 
trample the loosestrife down along the shore 
and where pron1 hornèd master sit in state 
bring strawberry and bloomy plum upon a wicker crate 

sing on   and soon with passion weary face 
through the cool leave person1 be lad will come 
the tyrian prince pron1 bristled boar will chase 
person1 the chestnut copse all a bloom 
and ivory limbe person1 eye with look of pride 
after person1 velvet coat deer the person1 person1 will ride 

sing on   and pron1 the die boy will see 
stain with pron1 purple blood the waxen bell 
that overweigh the jacinth and to pron1 
the wretched cyprian pron1 woe will tell 
and pron1 will kiss pron1 mouth and stream eye 
and lead pron1 to the myrtle hide grove where person1 lie 

cry out aloud on itys   memory 
that foster brother of remorse and pain 
drop poison in mine ear o to be free 
to burn ordinal1 be old ship   and to launch again 
into the white plume battle of the wave 
and fight old proteus for the spoil of coral flower cave 

o for person1 with pron1 poppied spell 
o for the secret of the colchian shrine 
o for ordinal1 leaf of that pale asphodel 
which bind the tired brow of proserpine 
and shed such wondrous dew at eve that pron1 
dream of the field of person1 by the far sicilian sea 

where oft the golden girdled bee pron1 chase 
from lily to lily on the level mead 
person1 yet pron1 sombre person1 have bid pron1 taste 
the deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed 
person1 the black steed have harry pron1 away 
down to the faint and flowerless land the sick and sunless day 

o for ordinal1 midnight and as person1 
the venu of the little melian farm 
o that some antique statue for ordinal1 hour 
might wake to passion and that pron1 could charm 
the dawn at florence from pron1 dumb despair 
mix with those mighty limb and make that giant breast pron1 lair 

sing on   sing on   pron1 would be drunk with life 
drunk with the trample vintage of pron1 youth 
pron1 would forget the wearying waste strife 
the riven veil the person1 eye of truth 
the prayerless vigil and the cry for prayer 
the barren gift the lift arm the dull insensate air 

sing on   sing on   o feather niobe 
thou canst make sorrow beautiful and steal 
from joy pron1 sweetest music not as pron1 
pron1 by dead voiceless silence strive to heal 
pron1 too untented wound and do but keep 
pain barricado in pron1 heart and murder pillow sleep 

sing louder yet why must pron1 still behold 
the person1 white face of that person1 person1 
whose bleeding hand pron1 hand do once enfold 
whose smite lip pron1 lip so oft have kiss 
and now in mute and marble misery 
sit in pron1 person1 person1 house and weep perchance for pron1 

o memory cast down pron1 person1 shell 
break pron1 hoarse lute o sad melpomene 
o sorrow sorrow keep pron1 cloistered cell 
nor dim with tear this limpid person1 
cease philomel pron1 dost the forest wrong 
to vex pron1 person1 quiet with such wild impassioned song 

cease cease or if not be anguish to be dumb 
take from the pastoral thrush pron1 simple air 
whose jocund carelessness doth more become 
this english woodland than pron1 keen despair 
ah   person1 and let the north wind bear person1 lie 
back to the rocky hill of thrace the stormy daulian person1 

a moment more the startled leave have stir 
person1 would have pass across the mead 
moonstruck with love and this still thame have hear 
person1 person1 and paddle grope for some reed 
to lure from pron1 blue cave pron1 person1 person1 
pron1 for such piping listen half in joy and half afraid 

a moment more the wake dove have coo 
the silver daughter of the person1 sea 
with the fond gyve of cling hand have woo 
pron1 wanton from the chase and dryope 
have thrust aside the branch of pron1 oak 
to see the lusty gold haired lad rein in pron1 snort yoke 

a moment more the tree have stoop to kiss 
person1 person1 just awaken from the swoon 
of tremulous laurel person1 person1 
have bare pron1 barren beauty to the moon 
and through the vale with sad voluptuous smile 
person1 have wander the red lotus of the person1 

down lean from pron1 black and cluster hair 
to shade those slumberous eyelid cavern bliss 
or else on yonder grassy slope with bare 
high tuniced limb unravished artemis 
have bid pron1 hound give tongue and rouse the deer 
from pron1 green ambuscade with shrill halloo and prick spear 

lie still lie still o passionate heart lie still 
o melancholy fold pron1 raven wing 
o sob dryad from pron1 hollow hill 
come not with such despondent answering 
no more thou wingèd person1 complain 
person1 loveth not to hear such troubled song of pain 

pron1 be a dream the glade be tenantless 
no soft ionian laughter move the air 
the thame creep on in sluggish leadenness 
and from the copse leave desolate and bare 
person1 be young person1 with pron1 revelry 
yet still from person1 wood pron1 come that thrilling melody 

so sad that pron1 might think a human heart 
brake in each separate note a quality 
which music sometimes have be the art 
which be most nigh to tear and memory 
poor mourn philomel pron1 dost thou fear 
thy sister doth not haunt these field pandion be not here 

here be no cruel person1 with murderous blade 
no woven web of bloody heraldry 
but mossy dell for rove comrade make 
warm valley where the tired student lie 
with half shut book and many a winding walk 
where rustic lover stray at eve in happy simple talk 

the harmless rabbit gambol with pron1 young 
across the trample towing path where late 
a troop of laugh boy in jostle throng 
cheer with pron1 noisy cry the racing ordinal1 
the gossamer with ravelled silver thread 
work at pron1 little loom and from the person1 person1 person1 shed 

of the lone farm a flicker light shine out 
where the swinke shepherd drive pron1 bleat flock 
back to pron1 wattle sheep cote a faint shout 
come from some person1 boat at person1 person1 
and start the moor hen from the person1 person1 
and the dim lengthen shadow flit like swallow up the hill 

the heron pass homeward to the mere 
the blue mist creep among the shiver tree 
gold world by world the silent star appear 
and like a blossom blow before the breeze 
a white moon drift across the shimmer sky 
person1 arbitress of all pron1 sad pron1 rapturous threnody 

pron1 do not heed pron1 wherefore should pron1 heed 
pron1 know endymion be not far away 
  tis pron1 notis pron1 whose soul be as the reed 
which have no message of pron1 own to play 
so pipe another be bid pron1 be pron1 
drift with every wind on the wide sea of misery 

ah   the brown bird have cease ordinal1 exquisite trill 
about the person1 person1 seem to cling 
die in music else the air be still 
so still that pron1 might hear the bat be small wing 
wander and wheel above the pine or tell 
each tiny dew drop drip from the bluebell be brim cell 

and far away across the lengthen wold 
across the willowy flat and thicket brown 
person1 be tall tower tip with tremulous gold 
mark the long high street of the little town 
and warn pron1 to return   pron1 must not wait 
person1   not be the curfew boom from the bell at person1 person1 gate
