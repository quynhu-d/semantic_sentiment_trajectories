pron1 make the consuls base and pron1 soul ache 
to know when ordinal1 authority be up 
neither supreme how soon confusion

coriolanus 
pron1 give that counsel to give forth 
the corn o the storehouse person1 as person1 use 
sometime in person1 
menenius 
well well no more of that 
coriolanus 
though pron1 the people have more absolute power 
pron1 say pron1 nourish would disobedience feed 
the ruin of the state 
person1 
why shall the people give 
one pron1 speak thus pron1 voice 
coriolanus 
pron1 will give pron1 reason 
more worthy than pron1 voice   pron1 know the corn 
be not pron1 recompense rest well assured 
that person1 er do service for not be press would to the war 
even when the navel of the state be touch would 
pron1 would not thread the gate   this kind of service 
do not deserve corn person1   be pron1 the war 
pron1 mutiny and revolt wherein pron1 show would 
most person1 speak not for pron1 the accusation 
which pron1 have often make against the person1 
all cause unborn could never be the motive 
of pron1 so frank donation   well pron1 then 
how shall this person1 multitude person1 
the person1 be courtesy   let deed express 
pron1 be like to be pron1 word pron1 do request pron1 
pron1 be the great poll and in true fear 
pron1 give pron1 pron1 demand   thus pron1 debase 
the nature of pron1 seat and make the rabble

of general ignorance pron1 must omit 
real necessity and give way the while 
to unstable slightness purpose so person1 would 
pron1 follow 
pron1 be do to purpose   therefore beseech pron1 
pron1 pron1 will be less fearful than discreet 
that love the fundamental part of state 
more than pron1 doubt the change o not that prefer

let pron1 puff all about mine ear present pron1 
death on the wheel or at wild horse heel 
or pile ordinal1 hill on the tarpeian rock 
that the precipitation might down stretch 
below the beam of sight yet will pron1 still 
be thus to pron1 
a patrician 
pron1 do the nobler 
coriolanus 
pron1 muse pron1 mother 
do not approve pron1 far pron1 be will not 
to call pron1 woollen vassal thing create 
to buy and sell with groat to show bare head 
in congregation to yawn be still and wonder 
when ordinal1 but of pron1 ordinance stand up 
to speak of peace or war 
enter pron1 

pron1 talk of pron1 
why do pron1 wish pron1 mild   would pron1 have pron1 
false to pron1 nature   rather say pron1 play 
the man pron1 be 
volumnia 
o sir person1 person1 
pron1 would have have pron1 put pron1 power well on 
before pron1 have wear pron1 out 
coriolanus 
let go 
volumnia 
pron1 might have be enough the man pron1 be 
with strive less to be so   person1 have be 
the thwarting of pron1 disposition if 
pron1 have not show would pron1 how pron1 be dispose 
person1 pron1 lack would power to cross pron1

pron1 have a heart as little apt as pron1 
but yet a brain pron1 lead pron1 use of anger 
to well vantage 
menenius 
well say noble woman 
before pron1 should thus stoop to the herd but that 
the violent fit o the time crave pron1 as physic 
for the whole state pron1 would put mine armour on 
which pron1 can scarcely bear 
coriolanus 
pron1 must pron1 do 
menenius 
return to the tribune 
coriolanus 
well pron1 then   pron1 then 
menenius 
repent pron1 pron1 have speak 
coriolanus 
for pron1   pron1 can not do pron1 to the god 
must pron1 then do not to pron1 
volumnia 
pron1 be too absolute 
though therein pron1 can never be too noble 
but when extremity speak   pron1 have hear pron1 say 
honour and policy like unsever would friend 
pron1 the war do grow together grant that and tell pron1 
in peace pron1 each of pron1 by the other lose 
that pron1 combine not there 
coriolanus

coriolanus 
why force pron1 this 
volumnia 
because that now pron1 lie pron1 on to speak 
to the people   not by pron1 own instruction 
nor by the matter which pron1 heart prompt pron1 
but with such word pron1 be but root in 
pron1 tongue though but bastard and syllable 
of no allowance to pron1 bosom be truth 
now this no more dishonour pron1 at all 
than to take in a town with gentle word 
which else would put pron1 to pron1 fortune and 
the hazard of much blood 
pron1 would dissemble with pron1 nature where 
pron1 fortune and pron1 friend at stake require 
pron1 should do so in honour pron1 be in this 
pron1 wife pron1 son these senator the noble 
and pron1 will rather show pron1 general lout 
how pron1 can frown than spend a fawn upon pron1
