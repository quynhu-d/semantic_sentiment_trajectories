charmide 
pron1 

pron1 be a grecian lad pron1 come home 
with pulpy fig and wine from sicily 
stand at pron1 galley be prow and let the foam 
blow through pron1 crisp brown curl unconsciously 
and hold wave and wind in boy be despite 
person1 from pron1 dripping seat across the wet and stormy night 

till with the dawn pron1 see a burnished spear 
like a thin thread of gold against the sky 
and hoist sail and strain the creak gear 
and bid the pilot head pron1 lustily 
against the nor person1 person1 and all day long 
hold on pron1 way and mark the rower time with measure song 

and when the faint corinthian hill be red 
drop anchor in a little sandy bay 
and with fresh bough of olive crown pron1 head 
and brush from cheek and throat the hoary spray 
and wash pron1 limb with oil and from the hold 
bring out pron1 linen tunic and pron1 sandal person1 sole 

and a rich robe stain with the fisher juice 
which of some swarthy trader pron1 have buy 
upon the sunny quay at person1 
and be with tyrian broiderie person1 
and by the questioning merchant make pron1 way 
up through the soft and silver wood and when the labour day 

have spin pron1 tangled web of crimson person1 
clomb the high hill and with swift silent foot 
creep to the fane unnoticed by the crowd 
of busy priest and from some dark retreat 
watch the young swain pron1 frolic playmate bring 
the firstling of pron1 little flock and the shy shepherd fle 

the crackling salt upon the flame or hang 
pron1 studded crook against the person1 wall 
to pron1 pron1 keep away the ravenous fang 
of the base wolf from homestead and from stall 
and then the clear voice maiden person1 to sing 
and to the altar each man bring some goodly offering 

a beechen cup brim with milky foam 
a fair cloth work with cunning imagery 
of hound in chase a waxen honey comb 
drip with oozy gold which scarce the bee 
have cease from build a black skin of oil 
meet for the wrestler a great boar the fierce and white tusked spoil 

steal from person1 that jealous maid 
to please person1 and the dappled hide 
of a tall stag pron1 in some mountain glade 
have meet the shaft   and then the herald cry 
and from the pillared precinct ordinal1 by ordinal1 
go the glad person1 well please that pron1 pron1 simple vow have do 

and the old priest put out the wane fire 
save that ordinal1 lamp whose restless ruby glow 
for ever in the cell and the shrill lyre 
come fainter on the wind as down the road 
in joyous dance these country folk do pass 
and with stout hand the warder close the gate of polished brass 

long time pron1 lie and hardly dare to breathe 
and hear the cadence drip of spilt out wine 
and the rose petal fall from the wreath 
as the night breeze wander through the shrine 
and seem to be in some entranc√®d swoon 
till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon 

flood with sheeny wave the marble floor 
when from pron1 nook up leap the venturous lad 
and fling wide the cedar person1 door 
person1 an awful image saffron clothe 
and arm for battle   the gaunt person1 glare 
from the huge helm and the long lance of wreck and ruin flare 

like a red rod of flame stony and steel 
the person1 be head pron1 leaden eyeball roll 
and writhe pron1 snaky horror through the shield 
and gape aghast with bloodless lip and cold 
in passion impotent while with blind gaze 
the blink owl between the foot hoot in shrill amaze 

the lonely fisher as pron1 trim pron1 lamp 
far out at sea off sunium or cast 
the net for tunny hear a brazen tramp 
of horse smite the wave and a wild blast 
divide the fold curtain of the night 
and knelt upon the little poop and pray in holy fright 

and guilty lover in pron1 venery 
person1 a little while pron1 steal sweet 
deeming pron1 hear person1 person1 be bitter cry 
and the grim watchman on pron1 lofty seat 
person1 to pron1 shield in haste precipitate 
or strained black bearded throat across the dusky parapet 

for round the temple roll the clang of arm 
and the ordinal1 god leap up in marble fear 
and the air quake with dissonant alarum 
till huge poseidon shake pron1 mighty spear 
and on the frieze the prance horse neigh 
and the low tread of hurry foot ring from the cavalcade 

ready for death with part lip pron1 stand 
and well content at such a price to see 
that calm wide brow that terrible maidenhood 
the marvel of that person1 chastity 
ah   well content indeed for never wight 
since person1 be young shepherd prince have see so wonderful a sight 

ready for death pron1 stand but lo   the air 
grew silent and the horse cease to neigh 
and off pron1 brow pron1 toss the cluster hair 
and from pron1 limb pron1 throw the cloak away 
for pron1 would not such love make desperate 
and nigh come and touch pron1 throat and with hand violate 

undo the cuirass and the crocus gown 
and bare the breast of polished ivory 
till from the waist the peplo fall down 
leave visible the secret mystery 
which to no lover will athena show 
the grand cool flank the crescent thigh the bossy hill of snow 

those pron1 have never know a lover be sin 
let pron1 not read pron1 ditty pron1 will be 
to pron1 dull ear so musicless and thin 
that pron1 will have no joy of pron1 but ye 
to whose person1 cheek now creep the linger smile 
person1 pron1 have learn pron1 eros be o listen yet awhile 

a little space pron1 let pron1 greedy eye 
rest on the burnished image till mere sight 
half swoon for surfeit of such luxury 
and then pron1 lip in hunger delight 
fed on pron1 lip and round the tower neck 
pron1 fling pron1 arm nor care at all pron1 passion be will to check 

never pron1 person1 do person1 hold such tryst 
for all night long pron1 murmur honeyed word 
and see pron1 sweet unravished limb and kiss 
pron1 pale and argent body undisturbed 
and paddle with the polished throat and press 
pron1 hot and beat heart upon pron1 chill and icy breast 

pron1 be as if numidian javelin 
pierce through and through pron1 wild and whirling brain 
and pron1 nerve thrill like throbbing violin 
in exquisite pulsation and the pain 
be such sweet anguish pron1 pron1 never draw 
pron1 lip from pron1 till overhead the lark of warning fly 

pron1 pron1 have never see the daylight peer 
into a darken room and draw the curtain 
and with dull eye and weary from some dear 
and worship body rise pron1 for certain 
will never know of pron1 pron1 try to sing 
how long the last kiss be how fond and late pron1 lingering 

the moon be girdle with a crystal rim 
the sign which shipman say be ominous 
of wrath in person1 the person1 star be dim 
and the low person1 person1 be tremulous 
with the faint fluttering wing of fly dawn 
person1 from the silent sombre shrine pron1 lover have withdraw 

down the steep rock with hurried foot and fast 
clomb the brave lad and reach the cave of pan 
and hear the goat foot snore as pron1 pass 
and leapt upon a grassy person1 and run 
like a young fawn unto an olive wood 
which in a shady valley by the well build city stand 

and seek a little stream which well pron1 know 
for oftentime with boyish careless shout 
the green and crested grebe pron1 would pursue 
or snare in weave net the silver trout 
and down amid the startled reed pron1 lie 
pant in breathless sweet affright and wait for the day 

on the person1 person1 pron1 lie and let ordinal1 hand 
dip in the cool dark eddy listlessly 
and soon the breath of morning come and fan 
pron1 hot flushed cheek or lift wantonly 
the tangle curl from off pron1 forehead while 
pron1 on the run water gaze with strange and secret smile 

and soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak 
with pron1 long crook undo the wattle cote 
and from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke 
curl through the air across the ripen oats 
and on the hill the person1 person1 dog bay 
as through the crisp and rustle fern the heavy cattle stray 

and when the light foot mower go afield 
across the meadow lace with threaded dew 
and the sheep bleat on the misty weald 
and from pron1 nest the wake corncrake fly 
some person1 see pron1 lie by the stream 
and marvel much that any lad so beautiful could seem 

nor deem pron1 bear of mortal and one say 
  pron1 be young hyla that false runaway 
pron1 with a naiad now would make pron1 bed 
forget herakle but other nay 
pron1 be narcissus pron1 own person1 
those be the fond and crimson lip no woman can allure   

and when pron1 near come a third one cry 
  pron1 be young dionyso pron1 have hide 
pron1 spear and fawnskin by the river side 
weary of hunt with the bassarid 
and wise indeed be pron1 away to fly 
pron1 live not long pron1 on the god immortal come to spy   

so turn pron1 back and fear to look behind 
and tell the timid swain how pron1 have see 
amid the reed some woodland person1 recline 
and no man dare to cross the open green 
and on that day no olive tree be slay 
nor rush cut but all desert be the fair domain 

save when the neat herd be lad pron1 empty pail 
well sling upon pron1 back with leap and bind 
race on the other side and stop to hail 
hope that pron1 some comrade new have find 
and gat no answer and then half afraid 
pass on pron1 simple way or down the still and silent glade 

a little girl run laugh from the farm 
not think of love be secret mystery 
and when pron1 see the white and gleaming arm 
and all pron1 manlihood with longing eye 
whose passion mock pron1 sweet virginity 
watch pron1 awhile and then steal back sadly and wearily 

far off pron1 hear the city be hum and noise 
and now and then the shrill laughter where 
the passionate purity of brown limbe boy 
wrestle or race in the clear healthful air 
and now and then a little tinkle bell 
as the shorn wether lead the sheep down to the mossy well 

through the grey willow dance the fretful gnat 
the grasshopper chirp idly from the tree 
in sleek and oily coat the water rat 
breast the little ripple manfully 
make for the wild duck be nest from bough to bough 
hop the shy finch and the huge tortoise creep across the slough 

on the faint wind float the silky seed 
as the bright scythe sweep through the wave grass 
the ouzel cock splash circle in the reed 
and fleck with silver whorls the forest be glass 
which scarce have catch again pron1 imagery 
person1 from pron1 bed the person1 person1 leap at the dragon fly 

but little care have pron1 for any thing 
though up and down the beech the squirrel play 
and from the copse the person1 person1 to sing 
to pron1 brown mate pron1 person1 serenade 
ah   little care indeed for pron1 have see 
the breast of person1 and the naked wonder of the queen 

but when the herdsman call pron1 straggle goat 
with whistle pipe across the rocky road 
and the shard beetle with pron1 trumpet note 
boom through the darken wood and seem to bode 
of come storm and the belate crane 
pass homeward like a shadow and the dull big drop of rain 

fell on the patter fig leave up pron1 rise 
and from the gloomy forest go pron1 way 
past sombre homestead and wet orchard close 
and come at last unto a little quay 
and call pron1 mate aboard and take pron1 seat 
on the high poop and push from land and loose the dripping sheet 

and steer across the bay and when ordinal1 sun 
pass down the long and ladder way of gold 
and ordinal1 pale moon have breathe pron1 orison 
to the chaste star pron1 confessor or tell 
pron1 dear secret to the person1 moth 
that will not fly at noonday through the foam and surge froth 

come a great owl with yellow sulphurous eye 
and light upon the ship whose timber creak 
as though the lading of ordinal1 argosy 
be in the hold and flap pron1 wing and shriek 
and darkness person1 steal across the deep 
person1 be orion be sword dread person1 pron1 flee down the steep 

and the moon hide behind a person1 mask 
of drift cloud and from the ocean be marge 
person1 the red plume the huge and person1 person1 
the ordinal1 cubit spear the brazen targe 
and clothe in bright and burnish panoply 
person1 stride across the stretch of sick and shiver sea 

to the dull sailor sight pron1 loosen look 
seem like the jagged storm rack and pron1 foot 
only the spume pron1 float on hide rock 
and mark how the rise water beat 
against the rolling ship the pilot cry 
to the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side 

but pron1 the overbold adulterer 
a dear profaner of great mystery 
an ardent amorous idolater 
when pron1 behold those grand relentless eye 
laugh loud for joy and cry out pron1 come 
person1 from the lofty poop into the chill and churn foam 

then fall from the high person1 ordinal1 bright star 
ordinal1 dancer leave the circle galaxy 
and back to person1 on pron1 clatter car 
in all the pride of venge divinity 
person1 person1 sweep with shrill and steely clank 
and a few gurgle bubble rise where pron1 boy person1 sink 

and the mast shudder as the gaunt owl fly 
with mock hoot after the wrathful queen 
and the old pilot bid the tremble crew 
hoist the big sail and tell how pron1 have see 
close to the stern a dim and giant form 
and like a dipping swallow the stout ship dash through the storm 

and no man dare to speak of charmide 
deem that pron1 some evil thing have work 
and when pron1 reach the strait symplegade 
pron1 beach pron1 galley on the shore and seek 
the toll gate of the city hastily 
and in the market show pron1 brown and pictured pottery 

person1 

but some good person1 person1 have ruth and bare 
the boy be drown body back to grecian land 
and mermaid comb pron1 dank and dripping hair 
and smoothed pron1 brow and loose pron1 clenching hand 
some bring sweet spice from far araby 
and other bid the halcyon sing pron1 soft lullaby 

and when pron1 near pron1 old athenian home 
a mighty billow rise up suddenly 
upon whose oily back the clot foam 
person1 diapere in some strange fantasy 
and clasp pron1 unto pron1 glassy breast 
person1 landward like a white man steed upon a venturous quest 

now where person1 lean unto the sea 
pron1 lie a long and level stretch of lawn 
the rabbit know pron1 and the mountain bee 
for pron1 desert person1 and the faun 
be not afraid for never through the day 
come a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lad at play 

but often from the thorny labyrinth 
and tangled branch of the circle wood 
the stealthy hunter see young hyacinth 
hurl the polished disk and draw pron1 hood 
over pron1 guilty gaze and creep away 
nor dare to wind pron1 horn or else at the first break of day 

the dryad come and throw the leathern ball 
along the person1 shore and circumvent 
some goat eare person1 to be pron1 seneschal 
for fear of bold poseidon be ravishment 
and loose pron1 girdle with shy timorous eye 
person1 from the surf pron1 azure arm and purple beard should rise 

on this side and on that a rocky cave 
person1 with the person1 bell laburnum stand 
person1 be the beach save where some ebb wave 
leave pron1 faint outline etch upon the sand 
as though pron1 fear to be too soon forget 
by the green rush pron1 playfellow and yet pron1 be a spot 

so small that the inconstant butterfly 
could steal the hoarded money from each flower 
person1 pron1 be noon and still not satisfy 
pron1 over greedy love within an hour 
a sailor boy be pron1 but rude enow 
to land and pluck a garland for pron1 galley be paint prow 

would almost leave the little meadow bare 
for pron1 know pron1 of great pageantry 
only a few narcissi here and there 
stand separate in sweet austerity 
dot the unmown grass with silver star 
and here and there a daffodil wave tiny scimitar 

hither the billow bring pron1 and be glad 
of such dear servitude and where the land 
be virgin of all water lay the lad 
upon the golden margent of the strand 
and like a linger lover oft return 
to kiss those pallid limb which once with intense fire burn 

person1 the wet sea have quench that holocaust 
that self feed flame pron1 passionate person1 
ere grisly death with chill and nip frost 
have wither up those lily white and red 
which while the boy would through the forest range 
answer each other in a sweet antiphonal counter change 

and when at dawn the wood nymph hand in hand 
thread the person1 person1 pron1 satyr spy 
the boy be pale body stretch upon the sand 
and fear poseidon be treachery and cry 
and like bright sunbeam flit through a glade 
each startled dryad seek some safe and leafy ambuscade 

save ordinal1 white girl pron1 deem pron1 would not be 
so dread a thing to feel a sea person1 be arm 
crush pron1 breast in amorous tyranny 
and long to listen to those subtle charm 
insidious lover weave when pron1 would win 
some fenc√®d fortress and steal back again nor think pron1 sin 

to yield pron1 treasure unto ordinal1 so fair 
and lay beside pron1 thirsty with love be drouth 
call pron1 soft name play with pron1 tangle hair 
and with hot lip make havoc of pron1 mouth 
afraid pron1 might not wake and then afraid 
lest pron1 might wake too soon flee back and then fond renegade 

return to fresh assault and all day long 
person1 at pron1 side and laugh at pron1 new toy 
and hold pron1 hand and sing pron1 sweetest song 
then frown to see how froward be the boy 
pron1 would not with pron1 maidenhood entwine 
nor know that ordinal1 day since pron1 eye have look on proserpine 

nor know pron1 sacrilege pron1 lip have do 
but say pron1 will awake pron1 know pron1 well 
pron1 will awake at evening when the sun 
hang pron1 red shield on person1 be person1 
this sleep be but a cruel treachery 
to make pron1 love pron1 more and in some cavern of the sea 

deeper than ever fall the fisher be line 
already a huge triton blow pron1 horn 
and weave a garland from the crystalline 
and drift ocean tendril to adorn 
the emerald pillar of pron1 bridal bed 
for sphered in foam silver and with person1 person1 head 

pron1 ordinal1 will sit upon a throne of pearl 
and a blue wave will be pron1 canopy 
and at pron1 foot the water snake will curl 
in all pron1 amethystine panoply 
of diamonde mail and pron1 will mark 
the mullet swim by the mast of some storm founder bark 

person1 fin with eye of bossy gold 
like flake of crimson light and the great deep 
pron1 glassy portaled chamber will unfold 
and pron1 will see the paint dolphin sleep 
cradle by murmur halcyon on the rock 
where proteus in quaint suit of green pasture pron1 monstrous flock 

and tremulous opal hued anemone 
will wave pron1 purple fringe where pron1 tread 
upon the mirror floor and argosy 
of fish fleck with person1 scale will thread 
the drift cordage of the shattered wreck 
and honey colour amber bead pron1 twine limb will deck   

but when that baffle person1 of war the sun 
with gaudy person1 flying pass away 
into pron1 brazen house and ordinal1 by ordinal1 
the little yellow star begin to stray 
across the field of person1 ah   then indeed 
pron1 fear pron1 lip upon pron1 lip would never care to feed 

and cry awake already the pale moon 
wash the tree with silver and the wave 
creep grey and chilly up this sandy dune 
the croak frog be out and from the cave 
the nightjar shrieks the fluttering bat repass 
and the brown stoat with hollow flank creep through the dusky grass 

nay though pron1 art a person1 be not so coy 
for in person1 stream pron1 be a little reed 
that often whisper how a lovely boy 
lay with pron1 once upon a grassy mead 
pron1 when pron1 cruel pleasure pron1 have do 
spread wing of rustle gold and soar aloft into the sun 

be not so coy the person1 tremble still 
with great person1 be kiss and the fir 
whose cluster sister fringe the person1 person1 
person1 many a tale of that bold ravisher 
pron1 man call borea and pron1 have see 
the mock eye of person1 through the poplar be silvery sheen 

even the jealous naiad call pron1 fair 
and every morn a young and ruddy swain 
woos pron1 with apple and with lock of hair 
and seek to soothe pron1 virginal disdain 
by all the gift the gentle wood nymph love 
but yesterday pron1 bring to pron1 an iris plumage dove 

with little crimson foot which with pron1 store 
of ordinal1 spot egg the cruel lad 
have steal from the lofty sycamore 
at daybreak when pron1 amorous comrade have 
fly off in search of berried juniper 
which most pron1 love   the fretful wasp that early vintager 

of the blue grape hath not persistency 
so constant as this simple shepherd boy 
for pron1 poor lip pron1 joyous purity 
and laugh sunny eye might well decoy 
a dryad from pron1 oath to artemis 
for very beautiful be pron1 pron1 mouth be make to kiss 

pron1 argent forehead like a rise moon 
over the dusky hill of meeting brow 
be crescent shape the hot and tyrian noon 
lead from the myrtle grove no goodly spouse 
for cyther√¶a the first silky down 
fringe pron1 blushing cheek and pron1 young limb be strong and brown 

and pron1 be rich and fat and fleecy herd 
of bleat sheep upon pron1 meadow lie 
and many an earthen bowl of yellow curds 
be in pron1 homestead for the thievish fly 
to swim and drown in the pink clover mead 
keep pron1 sweet store for pron1 and pron1 can pipe on oaten reed 

and yet pron1 love pron1 not   pron1 be for pron1 
pron1 keep pron1 love   pron1 know that person1 would ist come 
to rid pron1 of this pallid chastity 
thou fair flower of the flowerless foam 
of all the wide √¶gean bright star 
of ocean be azure heaven where the mirror planet be 

pron1 know that person1 would ist come for when at first 
the dry wood burgeon and the sap of spring 
swell in pron1 green and tender bark or burst 
to myriad multitudinous blossoming 
which mock the midnight with pron1 mimic moon 
that do not dread the dawn and first the thrush rapturous tune 

startle the squirrel from pron1 granary 
and cuckoo flower fringe the narrow lane 
through pron1 young leave a sensuous ecstasy 
creep like new wine and every mossy vein 
throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood 
and the wild wind of passion shake pron1 slim stem be maidenhood 

the trooping fawn at evening come and lay 
pron1 cool black nose on pron1 low bough 
and on pron1 topmost branch the person1 make 
a little nest of grass for pron1 spouse 
and now and then a twitter wren would light 
on a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight 

pron1 be the attic shepherd be tryste place 
beneath pron1 shadow person1 lie 
and round pron1 trunk would laugh person1 chase 
the timorous girl till tired out with play 
pron1 feel pron1 hot breath stir pron1 tangle hair 
and turn and look and flee no more from such delightful snare 

then come away unto pron1 ambuscade 
where cluster woodbine weave a canopy 
for amorous pleasaunce and the rustle shade 
of paphian myrtle seem to sanctify 
the dear rite of love   there in the cool 
and green recess of pron1 farth depth pron1 be pool 

the ouzel be haunt the wild bee be pasturage 
for round pron1 rim great creamy lily float 
through pron1 flat leave in verdant anchorage 
each cup a white sail person1 person1 boat 
steer by a dragon fly be not afraid 
to leave this wan and wave kiss shore surely the place be make 

for lover such as pron1   the cyprian queen 
ordinal1 arm around pron1 boyish person1 
stray often there at eve and pron1 have see 
the moon strip off pron1 misty vestiture 
for young endymion be eye   be not afraid 
the panther foot of dian never tread that person1 person1 

nay if pron1 will ist back to the beat brine 
back to the boisterous billow let pron1 go 
and walk all day beneath the hyaline 
huge vault of neptune be watery portico 
and watch the purple monster of the deep 
sport in ungainly play and from pron1 lair keen person1 person1 

for if pron1 mistress find pron1 lie here 
pron1 will not ruth or gentle pity show 
but lay pron1 boar spear down and with austere 
relentless finger string the cornel bow 
and draw the feather notch against pron1 breast 
and loose the arch√®d cord   person1 even now upon the quest 

pron1 hear pron1 hurry foot awake person1 
thou laggard in love be battle   once at least 
let pron1 drink deep of passion be wine and slake 
pron1 parch√®d be with the nectarous feast 
which even god affect   o come love come 
still pron1 have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home   

scarce have pron1 speak when the shudder tree 
shake and the leave divide and the air 
grew conscious of a person1 and the person1 person1 
crawl backward and a long and dismal blare 
blew from some tassel horn a sleuth person1 bay 
and like a flame a barb√®d reed fly whiz down the glade 

and where the little flower of pron1 breast 
just brake into pron1 milky blossoming 
this murderous paramour this unbidden guest 
person1 and strike deep in horrid chambering 
and plough a bloody furrow with pron1 dart 
and dig a long red road and cleft with wing√®d death pron1 heart 

sob pron1 life out with a bitter cry 
on the boy be body fall the dryad maid 
sob for incomplete virginity 
and rapture unenjoyed and pleasure dead 
and all the pain of thing unsatisfied 
and the bright drop of crimson youth creep down pron1 throbbing side 

ah   pitiful pron1 be to hear pron1 moan 
and very pitiful to see pron1 die 
person1 pron1 have yield up pron1 sweet or know 
the joy of passion pron1 dread mystery 
which not to know be not to live at all 
and yet to know be to be hold in death be most deadly thrall 

but as pron1 hapt the queen of person1 
pron1 with adoni all night long have lie 
within some shepherd be hut in person1 
on team of silver dove and gild person1 
be journey paphos ward high up afar 
from mortal person1 between the mountain and the morning star 

and when low down pron1 spy the hapless pair 
and hear the oread be faint despair cry 
whose cadence seem to play upon the air 
as though pron1 be a viol hastily 
pron1 bid pron1 pigeon fold each strain plume 
and dropt to earth and reach the strand and see pron1 dolorous doom 

for as a gardener turn back pron1 head 
to catch the last note of the person1 person1 
with careless scythe too near some flower bed 
and cut the thorny pillar of the rose 
and with the flower be loosen loneliness 
strew the brown mould   or as some shepherd lad in wantonness 

drive pron1 little flock along the mead 
tread down ordinal1 daffodil which side by aide 
have lure the lady bird with person1 person1 
and make the gaudy moth forget pron1 pride 
tread down pron1 brim golden chalice 
under light foot which be not make for such rude ravage 

or as a schoolboy tired of pron1 book 
fling pron1 down upon the reedy grass 
and pluck ordinal1 water lily from the person1 
and for a time forget the hour glass 
then wearie of pron1 sweet and go pron1 way 
and let the hot sun kill pron1 even go these lover lay 

and venu cry pron1 be dread person1 
whose bitter hand hath work this cruelty 
or else pron1 mighty maid whose care pron1 be 
to guard pron1 strong and stainless person1 
upon the hill athenian alas 
that pron1 pron1 love so well unloved into death be house should pass   

so with soft hand pron1 lay the boy and girl 
in the great golden waggon tenderly 
  pron1 white throat white than a moony pearl 
just thread with a blue vein be tapestry 
have not yet cease to throb and still pron1 breast 
swayed like a wind stir lily in ambiguous unrest 

and then each pigeon spread pron1 milky van 
the bright car soar into the dawn sky 
and like a cloud the aerial caravan 
pass over the √¶gean silently 
till the faint air be trouble with the song 
from the person1 mouth pron1 call on bleed thammuz all night long 

but when the dove have reach pron1 wonte goal 
where the wide stair of orb√®d marble dip 
pron1 snow into the sea pron1 flutter soul 
just shake the tremble petal of pron1 lip 
and pass into the void and person1 know 
that ordinal1 fair maid the less would walk amid pron1 retinue 

and bid pron1 servant carve a cedar chest 
with all the wonder of this history 
within whose scented womb pron1 limb should rest 
where olive tree make tender the blue sky 
on the low hill of paphos and the faun 
pipe in the noonday and the nightingale sing on till dawn 

nor fail pron1 to obey pron1 h and ere 
the morning bee have sting the daffodil 
with tiny fretful spear or from pron1 lair 
the wake stag have leap across the rill 
and rouse the ouzel or the lizard creep 
person1 the sunny rock beneath the grass pron1 body sleep 

and when day brake within that silver shrine 
feed by the flame of cresset tremulous 
person1 person1 kneel and pray to proserpine 
that pron1 whose beauty make death amorous 
should beg a guerdon from pron1 pallid person1 
and let desire pass across person1 person1 be icy person1 

iii 

in melancholy moonless acheron 
farm for the goodly earth and joyous day 
where no spring ever bud nor ripen sun 
weigh down the apple tree nor flowery may 
person1 with chestnut bloom the grassy floor 
where thrush never sing and piping linnet mate no more 

there by a dim and dark leth√¶an well 
young charmide be lie   person1 
pron1 pluck the blossom from the asphodel 
and with pron1 little rifled treasury 
person1 the dull water of the dusky stream 
and watch the white star founder and the land be like a dream 

when as pron1 gaze into the watery glass 
and through pron1 brown hair be curly tangle scan 
pron1 own person1 face a shadow seem to pass 
across the mirror and a little hand 
stole into pron1 and warm lip timidly 
brush pron1 pale cheek and breathe pron1 secret forth into a sigh 

then turn pron1 round pron1 weary eye and see 
and ever nigh still pron1 face come 
and nigh ever do pron1 young mouth draw 
until pron1 seem ordinal1 perfect rise of flame 
and longing arm around pron1 neck pron1 cast 
and feel pron1 throbbing bosom and pron1 breath come hot and fast 

and all pron1 hoard sweet be pron1 to kiss 
and all pron1 maidenhood be pron1 to slay 
and limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss 
pron1 passion wax and wane o why person1 
to pipe again of love too venturous reed 
enough enough that pron1 laugh upon that flowerless mead 

too venturous poesy o why person1 
to pipe again of passion   fold pron1 wing 
o er dare icarus and bid person1 lay 
sleep hide in the lyre be silent string 
till person1 hast find the old person1 rill 
or from the lesbian water pluck drown person1 be golden quid 

enough enough that pron1 whose life have be 
a fiery pulse of sin a splendid shame 
could in the loveless land of hade glean 
ordinal1 scorch harvest from those field of flame 
where passion walk with naked unshod foot 
and be not wound ah   enough that once pron1 lip could meet 

in that wild throb when all existence 
seem narrow to ordinal1 single ecstasy 
which die through pron1 own sweetness and the stress 
of too much pleasure person1 person1 
have bid pron1 serve pron1 by the person1 throne 
of the pale god pron1 in the field of person1 loose pron1 zone
