person1 
pron1 say ist thou to pron1 now   speak once again 
person1 
beware the ide of person1 
person1 
pron1 be a dreamer   let pron1 leave pron1 pass 
person1   person1 all except person1 and cassius 

person1 
will pron1 go see the order of the course 
person1 
not pron1 
person1 
pron1 pray pron1 do 
person1 
pron1 be not gamesome pron1 do lack some part 
of that quick spirit pron1 be in person1 
let pron1 not hinder cassius pron1 desire 
pron1 will leave pron1 
person1 
person1 pron1 do observe pron1 now of late 
pron1 have not from pron1 eye that gentleness 
and show of love as pron1 be will not to have 
pron1 bear too stubborn and too strange a hand 
over pron1 friend pron1 love pron1 
person1 
person1 
be not deceive if pron1 have veil would pron1 look 
pron1 turn the trouble of pron1 countenance 
merely upon pron1   vex pron1 be 
of late with passion of some difference 
conception only proper to pron1 
which give some soil perhaps to pron1 behavior 
but let not therefore pron1 good friend be grieve 
among which number cassius be pron1 one 
nor construe any far pron1 neglect 
than that poor person1 with pron1 at war 
forget the show of love to other man 
person1 
then person1 pron1 have much mistake pron1 passion 
by mean whereof this breast of mine hath bury 
thought of great value worthy cogitation 
tell pron1 good person1 can pron1 see pron1 face 
person1 
no cassius   for the eye see not pron1 
but by reflection by some other thing 
person1 
  tis just 
and pron1 be very much lament person1 
that pron1 have no such mirror as will turn 
pron1 hidden worthiness into pron1 eye 
that pron1 might see pron1 shadow   pron1 have hear 
where many of the good respect in person1 
except person1 person1 speak of person1 
and groan underneath this age be yoke 
have wish would that noble person1 have pron1 eye 
person1 
into what danger would pron1 lead pron1 cassius 
that pron1 would have pron1 seek into pron1 
for that which be not in pron1 
person1 
therefore good person1 be prepared to hear 
and since pron1 know pron1 can not see pron1 
so well as by reflection pron1 pron1 glass 
will modestly discover to pron1 
that of pron1 which pron1 yet know not of 
and be not jealous on pron1 gentle person1 
be pron1 a common laugher or do use 
to stale with ordinary oath pron1 love 
to every new protester   if pron1 know 
that pron1 do fawn on man and hug pron1 hard 
and after scandal pron1 or if pron1 know 
that pron1 profess pron1 in banquet 
to all the rout then hold pron1 dangerous 
flourish and shout 

person1 
pron1 mean this shout   pron1 do fear the people 
choose person1 for pron1 king 
person1 
ay do pron1 fear pron1 
then must pron1 think pron1 would not have pron1 so 
person1 
pron1 would not person1   yet pron1 love pron1 well 
but wherefore do pron1 hold pron1 here so long 
pron1 be pron1 that pron1 would impart to pron1 
if pron1 be aught toward the general good 
set honour in ordinal1 eye and death pron1 the other 
and pron1 will look on both indifferently 
for let the god so speed pron1 as pron1 love 
the name of honour more than pron1 fear death 
person1 
pron1 know that virtue to be in pron1 person1 
as well as pron1 do know pron1 outward favour 
well honour be the subject of pron1 story 
pron1 can not tell pron1 pron1 and other man 
think of this life   but for pron1 single self 
pron1 have as lief not be as live to be 
in awe of such a thing as pron1 pron1 
pron1 be bear free as person1   so be pron1 
pron1 both have feed as well and pron1 can both 
endure the winter be cold as well as pron1 
for once upon a raw and gusty day 
the troubled tiber chafing with pron1 shore 
person1 say to pron1 dar thou person1 now 
leap in with pron1 into this angry flood 
and swim to yonder point   upon the word 
person1 as pron1 be pron1 plunge in 
and bid pron1 follow   so indeed pron1 do 
the torrent roar would and pron1 do buffet pron1 
with lusty sinew throw pron1 aside 
and stem pron1 with heart of controversy 
but ere pron1 could arrive the point propose 
person1 cry help pron1 cassiu or pron1 sink   
pron1 as person1 pron1 great ancestor 
do from the flame of person1 upon pron1 shoulder 
the old anchise bear so from the wave of tiber 
do pron1 the person1 person1   and this man 
be now become a god and person1 be 
a wretched creature and must bend pron1 body 
if person1 carelessly but nod on pron1 
pron1 have a fever when pron1 be in person1 
and when the fit be on pron1 pron1 do mark 
how pron1 do shake notis true this person1 do shake 
pron1 coward lip do from pron1 colour fly 
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 
do lose pron1 lustre pron1 do hear pron1 groan 
ay and that tongue of pron1 pron1 bid the roman 
person1 pron1 and write pron1 speech in pron1 book 
alas pron1 cry give pron1 some drink person1 
as a sick girl   person1 god pron1 doth amaze pron1 
a man of such a feeble temper should 
so get the start of the majestic world 
and bear the palm alone 
shout   person1 

person1 
another general shout 
pron1 do believe that these applause be 
for some new honour pron1 be heap would on person1 
person1 
why man pron1 doth bestride the narrow world 
like a colossus and pron1 petty man 
walk under pron1 huge leg and peep about 
to find pron1 dishonourable grave 
man at some time be master of pron1 fate 
the fault dear person1 be not in pron1 star 
but in pron1 that pron1 be underling 
person1 and person1 pron1 should be in that person1   
why should that name be sound more than pron1 
write pron1 together pron1 be as fair a name 
sound pron1 pron1 doth become the mouth as well 
weigh pron1 pron1 be as heavy   conjure with pron1 
person1 will start a spirit as soon as person1 
now in the name of all the god at once 
upon pron1 meat doth this pron1 person1 feed 
that pron1 be grow so great   age pron1 art shame 
person1 person1 hast lose the breed of noble blood 
when go there by an age since the great flood 
but pron1 be fame with more than with ordinal1 man 
when could pron1 say till now that talk would of person1 
that pron1 wide wall encompass would but ordinal1 man 
now be pron1 person1 indeed and room enough 
when pron1 be in pron1 but ordinal1 only man 
o pron1 and pron1 have hear pron1 father say 
pron1 be a brutus once that would have person1 would 
the eternal devil to keep pron1 state in person1 
as easily as a king 
person1 
that pron1 do love pron1 pron1 be pron1 jealous 
pron1 pron1 would work pron1 to pron1 have some aim 
how pron1 have think of this and of these time 
pron1 shall recount hereafter   for this present 
pron1 would not so with love pron1 might entreat pron1 
be any far move   pron1 pron1 have say 
pron1 will consider   pron1 pron1 have to say 
pron1 will with patience hear and find a time 
both meet to hear and answer such high thing 
till then pron1 noble friend chew upon this 
person1 have rather be a villager 
than to repute pron1 a son of person1 
under these hard condition as this time 
be like to lay upon pron1 
person1 
pron1 be glad that pron1 weak word 
have strike but thus much show of fire from person1 
person1 
the game be do and person1 be return 
person1 
as pron1 pass by pluck person1 by the sleeve 
and pron1 will after pron1 sour fashion tell pron1 
pron1 hath proceed worthy note to day

and all the rest look like a person1 train 
person1 be cheek be pale   and person1

so soon as that spare cassius   pron1 read much

quite through the deed of man pron1 love no play 
as thou dost person1   pron1 hear no music

as if pron1 mock would pron1 and scorn would pron1 spirit 
that could be move to smile at any thing 
such man as pron1 be never at heart be ease 
while pron1 behold a great than pron1 
and therefore be pron1 very dangerous 
pron1 rather tell pron1 pron1 be to be fear would
