person1 imperatrix 
set in this stormy northern sea 
queen of these restless field of tide 
person1   pron1 shall man say of pron1 
before whose foot the world divide 

the earth a brittle globe of glass 
lie in the hollow of pron1 hand 
and through pron1 heart of crystal pass 
like shadow through a twilight land 

the spear of crimson suited war 
the long white crested wave of fight 
and all the deadly fire which be 
the torch of the lord of night 

the yellow leopard strain and lean 
the treacherous russian know so well 
with gape blacken jaw be see 
leap through the hail of scream shell 

the strong sea lion of person1 be war 
person1 leave pron1 sapphire cave of sea 
to battle with the storm pron1 person1 
the star of person1 be person1 

the person1 throate person1 blow 
across the person1 be reedy person1 
and the high person1 of person1 person1 
shake to the tread of armèd man 

and many an afghan chief pron1 lie 
beneath pron1 cool pomegranate tree 
clutch pron1 sword in fierce surmise 
when on the mountain side pron1 see 

the fleet foot marri scout pron1 come 
to tell how pron1 hath hear afar 
the measured roll of english drum 
beat at the gate of person1 

for southern wind and east wind meet 
where girt and crown by sword and fire 
person1 with bare and bloody foot 
climb the steep road of wide empire 

o lonely himalayan height 
person1 pillar of the person1 person1 
where see ist pron1 last in clang flight 
pron1 wingèd dog of victory 

the almond grove of person1 
person1 where red lily blow 
and person1 by whose yellow sand 
the grave white turbane merchant go 

and on from thence to 
the gilded garden of the sun 
whence the long dusty caravan 
bring cedar wood and vermilion 

and that dread city of person1 
set at the mountain be scarpèd foot 
whose marble tank be ever full 
with water for the noonday heat 

where through the narrow straight bazaar 
a little maid circassian 
be lead a present from the czar 
unto some old and bearded person1 

here have pron1 wild war eagle fly 
and flap wide wing in fiery fight 
but the sad dove pron1 sit alone 
in person1 pron1 hath no delight 

in vain the laugh girl will lean 
to greet pron1 love with love light eye 
down in some treacherous black ravine 
clutch pron1 flag the dead boy lie 

and many a moon and sun will see 
the linger wistful child wait 
to climb upon pron1 father be knee 
and in each house make desolate 

pale woman pron1 have lose pron1 lord 
will kiss the relic of the person1 
some tarnish epaulette some sword 
poor toy to soothe such anguish pain 

for not in quiet english field 
be these pron1 brother lain to rest 
where pron1 might deck pron1 broken shield 
with all the flower the dead love well 

for some be by the person1 wall 
and many in the afghan land 
and many where the gange fall 
through ordinal1 mouth of shift sand 

and some in russian water lie 
and other in the sea which be 
the portal to the east or by 
the wind sweep height of person1 

o wandering grave   o restless sleep 
o silence of the sunless day 
o still ravine   o stormy deep 
give up pron1 prey   give up pron1 prey 

and thou whose wound be never heal 
whose weary race be never win 
o person1 be person1   must thou yield 
for every inch of ground a son 

go   person1 with thorn pron1 gold crown head 
change pron1 glad song to song of pain 
wind and wild wave have get pron1 dead 
and will not yield pron1 back again 

wave and wild wind and foreign shore 
possess the flower of person1 land 
lip pron1 pron1 lip shall kiss no more 
hand pron1 shall never clasp pron1 hand 

what profit now that pron1 have bind 
the whole round world with net of gold 
if hide in pron1 heart be find 
the care pron1 groweth never old 

what profit pron1 pron1 galley ride 
pine forest like on every main 
ruin and wreck be at pron1 side 
grim warder of the house of pain 

where be the brave the strong the fleet 
where be pron1 person1 chivalry 
wild grass be pron1 burial sheet 
and sob wave pron1 threnody 

o love one lie far away 
what word of love can dead lip send 
o waste dust   o senseless clay 
be this the end   be this the end 

peace peace   pron1 wrong the noble dead 
to vex pron1 solemn slumber so 
though childless and with thorn crown head 
up the steep road must person1 go 

yet when this fiery web be spin 
pron1 watchman shall descry from far 
the young republic like a sun 
rise from these crimson sea of war
