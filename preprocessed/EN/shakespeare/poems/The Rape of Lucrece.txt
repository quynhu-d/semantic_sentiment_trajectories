from the besiege person1 all in post 
borne by the trustless wing of false desire 
person1 breathe tarquin leave the roman host 
and to collatium bear the lightless fire 
which in pale ember hide lurk to aspire 
and girdle with embrace flame the waist 
of collatine be fair love lucrece the chaste 
haply that name of chaste unhappily set 
this bateless edge on pron1 keen appetite 
when collatine unwisely do not let

which triumph would in that sky of pron1 delight 
where mortal star as bright as person1 be beauty 
with pure aspect do pron1 peculiar duty 
for pron1 the night before in person1 be tent 
person1 would the treasure of pron1 happy state 
what priceless wealth the person1 have pron1 lend 
in the possession of pron1 beauteous mate 
reckon pron1 fortune at such high proud rate 
that king might be espouse to more fame 
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame 
o happiness enjoy would but of a few 
and if possess would as soon decay would and do 
as be the morning be silver melt dew 
against the golden splendor of the sun 
an expired date cancell would ere well begin 
honour and beauty in the owner be arm 
be weakly fortress would from a world of harm 
beauty pron1 doth of pron1 persuade 
the eye of man without an orator 
pron1 person1 then apology be make 
to set forth that which be so singular 
or why be person1 the publisher 
of that rich jewel pron1 should keep unknown 
from thievish ear because pron1 be pron1 own 
perchance pron1 boast of lucrece sovereignty 
suggest this proud issue of a king 
for by pron1 ear pron1 heart oft taint be 
perchance that envy of so rich a thing 
brave compare disdainfully do ste 
pron1 high pitch would thought pron1 mean man should vaunt 
that golden hap which pron1 superior want 
but some untimely thought do instigate 
pron1 all too timeless speed if none of those

thy hasty spring still blast and person1 er grow old 
when at collatium this false person1 arrive 
well be pron1 welcome by the roman dame 
within whose face beauty and virtue strive 
which of pron1 both should underprop pron1 fame 
when virtue person1 would beauty would blush for shame 
when beauty boast blush in despite 
person1 would stain that o er with silver white 
but beauty in that white intitule 
from person1 dove person1 challenge that fair field 
then virtue claim from beauty beauty be red 
which virtue give the golden age to person1 
pron1 silver cheek and call would pron1 then pron1 shield 
teach pron1 thus to use pron1 in the fight 
when shame assail would the red should fence the white 
this heraldry in lucrece face be see

of either be colour be the other queen 
prove from world be minority pron1 right 
yet pron1 ambition make pron1 still to fight 
the sovereignty of either be so great

pron1 silent war of lily and of rose 
which tarquin view would in pron1 fair face be field 
in pron1 pure rank pron1 traitor eye enclose 
where lest between pron1 both pron1 should be kill would 
the coward captive vanquished person1 yield 
to those ordinal1 army pron1 would let pron1 go

now think pron1 that pron1 husband be shallow tongue 
the niggard person1 pron1 praise pron1 so 
in that high task hath do pron1 beauty wrong 
which far exceed pron1 barren skill to show 
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe 
enchanted tarquin answer with surmise 
in silent wonder of still gaze eye 
this earthly saint adore by this devil 
person1 person1 the false worshipper 
for unstain would thought do seldom dream on evil 
bird never lime no secret bush fear 
so guiltless pron1 securely give good cheer 
and reverend welcome to pron1 princely guest 
pron1 inward ill no outward harm express would 
for that pron1 colour would with pron1 high estate 
person1 base sin in plait of person1 
that pron1 in pron1 seem would inordinate 
save pron1 too much wonder of pron1 eye 
which have all all could not satisfy 
but poorly rich so person1 in pron1 store 
that cloy would with much pron1 pineth still for more 
but pron1 pron1 never cope with strange eye 
could pick no meaning from pron1 parling look 
nor read the subtle shine secrecy 
writ in the glassy margent of such book 
pron1 touch would no unknown bait nor fear would no hook 
nor could pron1 moralize pron1 wanton sight 
more than pron1 eye be open would to the light 
pron1 storie to pron1 ear pron1 husband be fame 
won in the field of fruitful person1 
and deck with praise person1 be high name 
make glorious by pron1 manly chivalry 
with bruised arm and wreath of victory 
pron1 joy with heaved up hand pron1 doth express 
and wordless so greet person1 for pron1 success 
far from the purpose of pron1 come hither 
pron1 make excuse for pron1 be there 
no cloudy show of stormy bluster weather 
person1 yet in pron1 fair welkin once appear 
till sable night mother of dread and fear 
upon the world dim darkness doth display 
and in pron1 vaulty prison stow the day 
for then be tarquin bring unto pron1 bed 
intend weariness with heavy spright 
for after supper long pron1 question 
with modest lucrece and wear out the night 
now leaden slumber with life be strength person1 fight 
and every one to rest pron1 betake 
save thief and care and troubled mind pron1 wake 
as ordinal1 of which doth tarquin lie revolve 
the sundry danger of pron1 will be obtain 
yet ever to obtain pron1 will resolve 
though weak build hope persuade pron1 to abstain 
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gain 
and when great treasure be the meed propose 
though death be adjunct pron1 be no death suppose 
those that much covet be with gain so fond 
for pron1 pron1 have not that which pron1 possess 
pron1 scatter and unloose pron1 from pron1 bond 
and so by hope more pron1 have but less 
or gain more the profit of excess 
be but to surfeit and such grief sustain 
that pron1 prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain 
the aim of all be but to nurse the life 
with honour wealth and ease in wane age 
and in this aim pron1 be such thwart strife 
that one for all or all for one pron1 gage 
as life for honour in fell battle be rage 
honour for wealth   and oft that wealth doth cost 
the death of all and all together lose 
so that in venture ill pron1 leave to be 
the thing pron1 be for that which pron1 expect 
and this ambitious foul infirmity 
in have much torment pron1 with defect 
of that pron1 have so then pron1 do neglect 
the thing pron1 have   and all for want of wit 
make pron1 pron1 by augment pron1 
such hazard now must dote tarquin make 
pawn pron1 honour to obtain pron1 lust 
and for pron1 pron1 be must forsake 
then where be truth if pron1 be no self trust 
when shall pron1 think to find a stranger just 
when pron1 pron1 pron1 confound betray 
to slanderous tongue and wretched hateful day 
now stole upon the time the dead of night 
when heavy sleep have close up mortal eye 
no comfortable star do lend pron1 light 
no noise but owl and wolf death boding cry 
now serve the season pron1 pron1 may surprise 
the silly lamb pure thought be dead and still 
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill 
and now this lustful person1 person1 would from pron1 bed 
throw pron1 mantle rudely o er pron1 arm 
be madly toss would between desire and dread 
th one sweetly flatter th other feareth harm 
but honest fear bewitch would with lust be foul charm 
person1 too too oft betake pron1 to retire 
beat away by brain sick rude desire 
pron1 falchion on a flint pron1 softly smiteth 
that from the cold stone spark of fire do fly 
person1 a waxen torch forthwith pron1 person1 
which must be lode star to pron1 lustful eye 
and to the flame thus speak advisedly 
  as from this cold flint pron1 enforce this fire 
so person1 must pron1 force to pron1 desire   
here pale with fear pron1 doth person1 
the danger of pron1 loathsome enterprise 
and in pron1 inward mind pron1 doth debate 
pron1 follow sorrow may on this arise 
then look scornfully pron1 doth despise 
pron1 naked armour of still slaughter would lust 
and justly thus control pron1 thought unjust 
  fair torch burn out pron1 light and lend pron1 not 
to darken pron1 whose light person1 thine 
and die unhallow would thought before pron1 blot 
with pron1 uncleanness that which be divine 
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine 
let fair humanity abhor the deed 
that spot and stain love be modest snow white weed 
  o shame to knighthood and to shine arm 
o foul person1 to pron1 household be grave 
o impious act include all foul harm 
a martial man to be soft fancy be slave 
true valour still a true respect should have 
then pron1 digression be so vile so base 
that pron1 will live person1 in pron1 face 
  yea though pron1 die the scandal will survive 
and be an eye sore in pron1 golden coat 
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive 
to cipher pron1 how fondly pron1 do dote 
that pron1 posterity shame with the note 
shall curse pron1 bone and hold pron1 for no sin 
to wish that pron1 pron1 father have not person1 
  pron1 win pron1 if pron1 gain the thing pron1 seek 
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy 
pron1 buy a minute be mirth to wail a week 
or sell eternity to get a toy 
for ordinal1 sweet grape pron1 will the vine destroy 
or pron1 fond beggar but to touch the crown 
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down 
  if collatinus dream of pron1 intent 
will pron1 not wake and in a desperate rage 
person1 hither this vile purpose to prevent 
this siege pron1 hath engirt pron1 marriage 
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage 
this die virtue this survive shame 
whose crime will bear an ever during blame 
  o what excuse can pron1 invention make 
when thou shalt charge pron1 with so black a deed 
will not pron1 tongue be mute pron1 frail joint shake 
mine eye forego pron1 light pron1 false heart bleed 
the guilt be great the fear doth still exceed 
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly 
but coward like with tremble terror die 
  have collatinus kill would pron1 son or sire 
or lain in ambush to betray pron1 life 
or be pron1 not pron1 dear friend this desire 
might have excuse to work upon pron1 wife 
as in revenge or quittal of such strife 
but as pron1 be pron1 kinsman pron1 dear friend 
the shame and fault find no excuse nor end 
  shameful pron1 be   ay if the fact be know 
hateful pron1 be   pron1 be no hate in love 
pron1 will beg pron1 love   but pron1 be own 
the bad be but denial and reprove 
pron1 will be strong past reason be weak remove 
pron1 fear a sentence or an old man be see 
shall by a paint cloth be keep in awe   
thus graceless hold pron1 disputation 
  tween frozen conscience and hot burning will 
and with good thought make dispensation 
urge the worse sense for vantage still 
which in a moment doth confound and kill 
all pure effect and doth so far proceed 
that pron1 be vile show like a virtuous deed 
quoth pron1 pron1 take pron1 kindly by the hand 
and gaze for tiding in pron1 eager eye 
fear some hard news from the warlike band 
where pron1 beloved collatinus lie 
o how pron1 fear do make pron1 colour rise 
first red as rose pron1 on lawn pron1 lay 
then white as lawn the rose take away 
  and how pron1 hand in pron1 hand be lock would 
force pron1 to tremble with pron1 loyal fear 
which strike pron1 sad and then pron1 fast rock would 
until pron1 husband be welfare pron1 do hear 
person1 pron1 smile with so sweet a cheer 
that have narcissus see pron1 as pron1 stand 
self love have never drown would pron1 in the flood 
  why hunt pron1 then for colour or excuse 
all orator be dumb when beauty pleadeth 
poor wretch have remorse in poor abuse 
love thrive not in the heart pron1 shadow person1 
affection be pron1 captain and pron1 leadeth 
and when pron1 gaudy banner be display would 
the coward fight and will not be dismay would 
  then childish fear person1   debate die 
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age 
pron1 heart shall never countermand mine eye 
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage 
pron1 part be youth and beat these from the stage 
desire pron1 pilot be beauty pron1 prize 
then pron1 fear sink where such treasure lie   
as corn o ergrown by weed so heedful person1 
be almost choke by unresisted lust 
away pron1 steal with open listening ear 
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust 
both which as servitor to the unjust 
so cross pron1 with pron1 opposite persuasion 
that now pron1 vow a league and now invasion 
within pron1 thought pron1 heavenly image sit 
and in the self same seat sit collatine 
that eye which look on pron1 confound pron1 wit 
that eye which pron1 behold as more divine 
unto a view so false will not incline 
but with a pure appeal seek to the heart 
which once corrupt take the worse part 
and therein hearten up pron1 servile power 
pron1 flatter would by pron1 leader be jocund show 
stuff up pron1 lust as minute fill up hour 
and as pron1 captain so pron1 pride doth grow 
pay more slavish tribute than pron1 owe 
by reprobate desire thus madly lead 
the roman person1 person1 to lucrece bed 
the lock between pron1 chamber and pron1 will 
each one by pron1 enforce retire pron1 ward 
but as pron1 open pron1 all rate pron1 ill 
which drive the creep thief to some regard 
the threshold grate the door to have pron1 hear 
night wander weasel shriek to see pron1 there 
pron1 fright pron1 yet pron1 still pursue pron1 fear 
as each unwilling portal yield pron1 way 
through little vent and cranny of the place 
the wind war with pron1 torch to make pron1 stay 
and blow the smoke of pron1 into pron1 face 
extinguish pron1 conduct in this case 
but pron1 hot heart which fond desire doth scorch 
puff forth another wind pron1 fire the torch 
and be light by the light pron1 spy 
person1 be glove wherein pron1 needle stick 
pron1 take pron1 from the rush where pron1 lie 
and gripe pron1 the needle pron1 finger prick 
as pron1 should say this glove to wanton trick 
be not inure   return again in haste 
person1 see ist pron1 mistress ornament be chaste   
but all these poor forbidding could not stay pron1 
pron1 in the bad sense construe pron1 denial 
the door the wind the glove pron1 do delay pron1 
pron1 take for accidental thing of trial 
or as those bar which stop the hourly dial 
pron1 with a linger slay pron1 course doth let 
till every minute pay the hour pron1 debt 
  so so quoth pron1 person1 let attend the time 
like little frost pron1 sometime threat the spring 
to add a more rejoicing to the prime 
and give the sneape bird more cause to sing 
pain pay the income of each precious thing 
huge rock high wind strong pirate shelf and sand 
the merchant fear person1 rich at home pron1 land   
now be pron1 come unto the chamber door 
that shut pron1 from the person1 of pron1 thought 
which with a yield latch and with no more 
person1 person1 would pron1 from the bless thing be seek 
so from pron1 impiety hath work 
that for pron1 prey to pray pron1 doth begin 
as if the heaven should countenance pron1 sin 
but in the midst of pron1 unfruitful prayer 
have solicit th eternal power 
that pron1 foul thought might compass pron1 fair fair 
and pron1 would stand auspicious to the hour 
even there pron1 start quoth pron1 pron1 must deflower 
the power to pron1 pron1 pray abhor this fact 
how can pron1 then assist pron1 in the act 
  then love and fortune be pron1 god pron1 guide 
pron1 will be back would with resolution 
thought be but dream till pron1 effect be try 
the black sin be clear would with absolution 
against love be fire fear be frost hath dissolution 
the eye of person1 be out and misty night 
cover the shame pron1 follow sweet delight   
this say pron1 guilty hand pluck would up the latch 
and with pron1 knee the door pron1 open wide 
the dove sleep fast that this night owl will catch 
thus treason work ere traitor be espy 
pron1 see the lurk serpent step aside 
but pron1 sound sleep fear no such thing 
lie at the mercy of pron1 mortal sting 
into the chamber wickedly pron1 stalk 
and gazeth on pron1 yet unstained bed 
the curtain be close about pron1 walk 
roll pron1 greedy eyeball in pron1 head 
by pron1 high treason be pron1 heart mislead 
which give the watch word to pron1 hand full soon 
to draw the cloud pron1 hide the silver moon 
look as the fair and fiery point sun 
rush from forth a cloud bereave pron1 sight 
even so the curtain draw pron1 eye begin 
to wink be blind with a great light 
whether pron1 be that pron1 reflect so bright 
that dazzleth pron1 or else some shame suppose 
but blind pron1 be and keep pron1 enclose 
o have pron1 in that darksome prison die 
then have pron1 see the period of pron1 ill 
then person1 again by person1 side 
in pron1 clear bed might have repose still 
but pron1 must ope this bless league to kill 
and holy thoughted person1 to pron1 sight

pron1 therefore angry seem to part in sunder 
swell on either side to want pron1 bliss 
between whose hill pron1 head entomb be 
where like a virtuous monument pron1 lie 
to be admire of lewd unhallow would eye 
without the bed pron1 other fair hand be

with pearly sweat resemble dew of night 
pron1 eye like marigold have sheathe pron1 light 
and canopy in darkness sweetly lie 
till pron1 might open to adorn the day 
pron1 hair like golden thread play would with pron1 breath 
o modest wanton   person1 modesty 
show life be triumph in the map of death 
and death be dim look in life be mortality 
each in pron1 sleep pron1 so beautify 
as if between pron1 twain pron1 be no strife 
but that life live in death and death in life 
pron1 breast like ivory globe circle with blue 
a pair of maiden world unconquere 
save of pron1 person1 no bear yoke pron1 know 
and pron1 by oath pron1 truly honour 
these world in tarquin new ambition breed

on pron1 bare breast the heart of all pron1 land 
whose rank of blue vein as pron1 hand do scale

person1 at pron1 tear and be compassionate 
soft pity enter at an iron gate 
  in person1 be likeness pron1 do entertain person1 
person1 pron1 put on pron1 shape to do pron1 shame 
to all the host of person1 pron1 complain pron1 
thou wrong ist pron1 honour wound person1 pron1 princely name 
thou art not pron1 person1 seem ist   and if the same 
person1 seem ist not pron1 thou art a person1 a king 
for king like god should govern pron1 
  how will thy shame be seed in thine age 
when thus pron1 vice bud before thy spring 
if in pron1 hope person1 dar do such outrage 
pron1 dar thou not when once pron1 art a king 
o be remember would no outrageous thing 
from vassal actor can be wipe away 
then king misdeed can not be hide in clay 
  this deed will make pron1 only love for fear 
but happy monarch still be fear would for love 
with foul offender person1 perforce must bear 
when pron1 in pron1 the like offence prove 
if but for fear of this thy will remove 
for prince be the glass the school the book 
where subject eye do learn do read do look 
  and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn 
must pron1 in pron1 read lecture of such shame 
person1 thou be glass wherein pron1 shall discern 
authority for sin warrant for blame 
to privilege dishonour in pron1 name 
thou black ist reproach against long live laud 
and makest fair reputation but a bawd 
  hast person1 command   by pron1 pron1 give pron1 thee 
from a pure heart command pron1 rebel will 
draw not pron1 sword to guard person1 
for pron1 be lend pron1 all that brood to kill 
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil 
when pattern would by pron1 fault foul sin may say 
pron1 learn would to sin and person1 didst teach the way 
  think but how vile a spectacle pron1 be 
to view pron1 present trespass in another 
men be fault do seldom to pron1 appear 
pron1 own transgression partially pron1 smother 
this guilt would seem death worthy in pron1 brother 
o how be pron1 wrapp would in with infamy 
that from pron1 own misdeed askance pron1 eye 
  to pron1 to pron1 pron1 heaved up hand appeal 
not to seduce lust pron1 rash relier 
pron1 sue for exiled person1 be repeal 
let pron1 return and flattering thought retire 
pron1 true respect will prison false desire 
and wipe the dim mist from person1 doting person1 
that thou shalt see pron1 state and pity mine   
  have do quoth pron1 amy uncontrolled tide 
turn not but swell the high by this let 
small light be soon blow out huge fire abide 
and with the wind in great fury fret 
the petty stream pron1 pay a daily debt 
to pron1 salt sovereign with pron1 fresh fall haste 
add to pron1 flow but alter not pron1 taste   
  thou art quoth pron1 a sea a sovereign king 
and person1 pron1 fall into pron1 boundless flood 
black lust dishonour shame misgovern 
pron1 seek to stain the ocean of thy blood 
if all these pretty ill shall change pron1 good 
thy sea within a puddle be womb be hearsed 
and not the puddle in pron1 sea disperse 
  so shall these slave be king and thou pron1 slave 
thou nobly base pron1 basely dignified 
thou pron1 fair life and pron1 thy fouler grave 
person1 loathe in pron1 shame pron1 in thy pride 
the less thing should not the great hide 
the cedar stoop not to the base shrub be foot 
but low shrub wither at the cedar be root 
  so let pron1 thought low vassal to pron1 state 
no more quoth pron1   by person1 pron1 will not hear pron1 
yield to pron1 love   if not enforce hate 
instead of love be coy touch shall rudely tear pron1 
that do despitefully pron1 mean to bear pron1 
unto the base bed of some rascal groom 
to be pron1 partner in this shameful doom   
this say pron1 set pron1 foot upon the light 
for light and lust be deadly enemy 
person1 fold up in blind conceal night 
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize 
the wolf person1 seize pron1 prey the poor lamb cry 
till with pron1 own white person1 pron1 voice controll would 
person1 pron1 outcry in pron1 lip sweet fold 
for with the nightly linen pron1 pron1 wear 
pron1 pen pron1 piteous clamour in pron1 head 
cool pron1 hot face in the chaste tear 
that ever modest eye with sorrow shed 
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed 
the spot whereof could weep purify 
pron1 tear should drop on pron1 perpetually 
but pron1 hath lose a dear thing than life 
and pron1 hath win pron1 pron1 would lose again 
this force league doth force a further strife 
this momentary joy breed month of pain 
this hot desire convert to cold disdain 
pure chastity be rifle of pron1 store 
and lust the thief far poor than before 
look as the full person1 person1 or gorge hawk 
person1 for tender smell or speedy flight 
make slow pursuit or altogether balk 
the prey wherein by nature pron1 delight 
so surfeit take tarquin fare this night 
pron1 taste delicious in digestion sour 
devour pron1 will pron1 live by foul devour 
o deep sin than bottomless conceit 
can comprehend in still imagination 
drunken desire must vomit pron1 receipt 
person1 pron1 can see pron1 own abomination 
while lust be in pron1 pride no exclamation 
can curb pron1 heat or rein pron1 rash desire 
till like a jade self will pron1 doth tire 
and then with person1 and lean person1 would cheek 
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace 
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek 
like to a bankrupt beggar wail pron1 case 
the flesh be proud desire doth fight with grace 
for there pron1 revel   and when that decay 
the guilty rebel for remission pray 
so fare pron1 with this faultful person1 of person1 
pron1 this accomplishment so hotly chase 
for now against pron1 pron1 sound this doom 
that through the length of time pron1 stand disgrace 
besides pron1 soul be fair temple be deface 
to whose weak ruin muster troop of care 
to ask the spot princess how pron1 fare 
pron1 say pron1 subject with foul insurrection 
have batter would down pron1 consecrate wall 
and by pron1 mortal fault bring in subjection 
pron1 immortality and make pron1 thrall 
to live death and pain perpetual 
which in pron1 prescience pron1 control still 
but pron1 foresight could not forestall pron1 will 
even in this thought through the dark night pron1 person1 
a captive victor pron1 hath lose in gain 
bear away the wound that pron1 person1 
the scar pron1 will despite of cure remain 
leave pron1 spoil perplex would in great pain 
pron1 bear the load of lust pron1 leave behind 
and pron1 the burden of a guilty mind 
pron1 like a thievish dog creep sadly thence 
pron1 like a wearied person1 lie pant there 
pron1 scowl and hate pron1 for pron1 offence 
pron1 desperate with pron1 nail pron1 flesh doth tear 
pron1 faintly fly sneak with guilty fear 
pron1 stay exclaim on the direful night 
pron1 run and chide pron1 vanish would loathe delight 
pron1 thence depart a heavy convertite 
pron1 pron1 remain a hopeless castaway 
pron1 in pron1 speed look for the morning light 
pron1 pray pron1 never may behold the day 
  for day quoth pron1 night scape doth open lay 
and pron1 true eye have never practise how 
to cloak offence with a cunning brow 
  pron1 think not but that every eye can see 
the same disgrace which pron1 pron1 behold 
and therefore would pron1 still in darkness be 
to have pron1 unseen sin remain untold 
for pron1 pron1 guilt with weeping will unfold 
and grave like water pron1 doth eat in steel 
upon pron1 cheek pron1 helpless shame pron1 feel   
here pron1 exclaim against repose and rest 
and bid pron1 eye hereafter still be blind 
pron1 wake pron1 heart by beat on pron1 breast 
and bid pron1 leap from thence where pron1 may find 
some purer chest to close so pure a mind 
frantic with grief thus breathe pron1 forth pron1 spite 
against the unseen secrecy of night 
  o comfort kill night image of hell 
dim register and notary of shame 
black stage for tragedy and murder fall 
vast sin conceal chaos   person1 of blame 
blind muffle bawd   person1 harbour for person1 
person1 cave of death   whispering conspirator 
with close tongue treason and the person1 
  o hateful vaporous and foggy night 
since thou art guilty of pron1 cureless crime 
person1 pron1 mist to meet the eastern light 
make war against proportion would course of time 
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb 
pron1 wonte height yet ere pron1 go to bed
