a note on salomé   
  salomé have make the author be name a household word wherever the english language be not speak   few english play have such a peculiar history   write in french in ordinal1 pron1 be in full rehearsal by person1 person1 at the palace theatre when pron1 be prohibit by the censor   person1 wilde immediately announce pron1 intention of change pron1 nationality a characteristic jest which be only take seriously oddly enough in person1   the interference of the censor have seldom be more popular or more heartily endorse by english critic   on pron1 publication in book form salomé be greet by a chorus of ridicule and pron1 may be note in pass that at least ordinal1 of the more violent review be from the pen of unsuccessful dramatist while all those whose french never go beyond ollendorff be glad to find in that venerable school classic an unsuspected asset in pron1 education a handy missile with which to pelt salomé and pron1 author   the correctness of the french be of course impugn although the scrip have be pass by a distinguished french writer to pron1 pron1 have hear the whole work attribute   the time while depreciate the drama give pron1 author credit for a tour de force in be capable of write a french play for person1 person1 and this draw from pron1 the follow letter

person1   person1 wilde on salomé   

to the editor of the time 

person1 pron1 attention have be draw to a review of salomé which be publish in pron1 column last week   the opinion of english critic on a french work of mine have of course little if any interest for pron1   pron1 write simply to ask pron1 to allow pron1 to correct a misstatement pron1 appear in the review in question 

the fact that the great tragic actress of any stage now live see in pron1 play such beauty pron1 pron1 be anxious to produce pron1 to take pron1 the part of the heroine to lend to the entire poem the glamour of pron1 personality and to pron1 prose the music of pron1 flute like voice this be naturally and always will be a source of pride and pleasure to pron1 and pron1 look forward with delight to see mme   person1 present pron1 play in person1 that vivid centre of art where religious drama be often perform   but pron1 play be in no sense of the word write for this great actress   pron1 have never write a play for any actor or actress nor shall pron1 ever do so   such work be for the artisan in literature not for the artist 

pron1 remain sir pron1 obedient servant 

person1 wilde 

when salomé be translate into person1 by person1 person1 person1 the illustrator person1 person1 share some of the obloquy heap on wilde   pron1 be interesting that pron1 should have find inspiration for pron1 fine work in a play pron1 never admire and by a writer pron1 cordially dislike   the motive be of course make to pron1 hand and never be pron1 a more suitable material for that odd tangent art in which pron1 be no tactile value   the amusing caricature of wilde which appear in the frontispiece enter herodia and the eye of person1 be the only piece of vraisemblance in these exquisite design   the person1 be a real masterpiece and a witty criticism of the play as well 

on the production of salomé by the new stage club in person1 ordinal1 ordinal1 the dramatic critic again express pron1 vehemently vociferate pron1 regret that the play have be drag from pron1 obscurity   the obscure drama however have become for ordinal1 year past part of the literature of person1   pron1 be perform regularly or intermittently in person1 person1 person1 person1 and person1 and pron1 have be translate into every european language include the person1   pron1 form part of the repertoire of the german stage where pron1 be perform more often than any play by any english writer except shakespeare   owe perhaps to pron1 pron1 must call pron1 obscure popularity in the person1 theatre person1   person1 be prepare pron1 remarkable opera at the very moment when pron1 appear the criticism to which pron1 refer and since the production of the opera in person1 in person1 ordinal1 person1 musical journalist and correspondent always refer to the work as found on wilde be drama   that be the only way in which pron1 can evade an awkward truth a palpable contravention to pron1 own wish and theory   the music however have be set to the actual word of salomé in person1 person1 person1 be admirable translation   the word have not be transfigure into ordinary operatic nonsense to suit the score or the susceptibility of the english people   pron1 observe that admirer of person1   person1 be a little mortify that the great master should have find an occasion for composition in a play which pron1 long ago consign to oblivion and the shamble of person1 person1   person1 pron1 in a rhetorical period seem to have contemplate the possibility of pron1 prose drama for a musical theme   in de profundis pron1 say the refrain whose recur motif make salomé so like a piece of music and bind pron1 together as a ballad   

pron1 be still incarcerate in ordinal1 when mon   person1 poë produce the play for the first time at the person1 person1 in person1 with person1 person1 in the title role   a rather pathetic reference to this occasion occur in a letter pron1 write to pron1 from read 

  please say how gratified pron1 be at the performance of pron1 play and have pron1 thank convey to person1 poë   pron1 be pron1 pron1 at a time of disgrace and shame pron1 should still be regard as an artist   pron1 wish pron1 could feel more pleasure but pron1 seem dead to all emotion except those of anguish and despair   however please let person1 poë know that pron1 be sensible of the honour pron1 have do pron1   pron1 be a poet pron1   write to pron1 in answer to this and try and see pron1 person1 person1 and person1 say of salomé   

the bias of personal friendship preclude pron1 from praise or defend salomé even if pron1 be necessary to do so   pron1 pron1 might say would add to the reputation of pron1 detractor   pron1 source be obvious   particularly flaubert and maeterlinck in whose peculiar and original style pron1 be an essay   a critic for pron1 pron1 have a great regard than many of pron1 contemporary say that salomé be only a catalogue   but a catalogue can be intensely dramatic as pron1 know when the performance take place at person1 be   few play be more exciting than an auction in person1 street when the star be fight for sisera 

pron1 have be remark that wilde confuse person1 the great mat   person1   ordinal1 person1 antipas mat   person1   ordinal1 and person1 person1 act person1 but the confusion be intentional as in mediæval mystery play person1 be take for a type not an historical character and the criticism be about as valuable as that of people pron1 laboriously point out the anachronism in beardsley be design   with reference to the charge of plagiarism bring against salomé and pron1 author pron1 venture to mention a personal recollection 

person1 complain to pron1 ordinal1 day pron1 pron1 in a well know novel have steal an idea of pron1   pron1 plead in defence of the culprit pron1 wilde pron1 be a fearless literary thief   pron1 dear fellow pron1 say with pron1 usual drawling emphasis when pron1 see a monstrous tulip with ordinal1 wonderful petal in pron1 else be garden pron1 be impel to grow a monstrous tulip with ordinal1 wonderful petal but that be no reason why pron1 should grow a tulip with only ordinal1 petal   that be oscar wilde 

person1 person1 

  ordinal1 a more recent performance of salomé ordinal1 by the literary theatre club have again produce an ebullition of rancour and deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the dramatic critic the majority of pron1 be anxious to parade pron1 ignorance of the continental stage   the production be remarkable on account of the beautiful dress and mount for which person1   person1 rickett be responsible and the marvellous impersonation of person1 by person1   person1 person1   person1 use to say that salomé be a mirror in which pron1 could see pron1   the artist art   the dull dulness   the vulgar vulgarity
