the sonnet 
by person1 person1 
pron1 
from fair creature pron1 desire increase 
that thereby beauty be rise might never die 
but as the riper should by time decease 
pron1 tender heir might bear pron1 memory 
but pron1 contract to thine own bright eye 
feed ist pron1 light be flame with self substantial fuel 
make a famine where abundance lie 
person1 pron1 foe to pron1 sweet self too cruel 
thou that art now the world be fresh ornament 
and only herald to the gaudy spring 
within thine own bud buriest pron1 content 
and person1 person1 person1 person1 waste in niggarding 
pity the world or else this glutton be 
to eat the world be due by the grave and pron1 
ii 
when ordinal1 winter shall besiege pron1 brow 
and dig deep trench in pron1 beauty be field 
thy youth be proud livery so gaze on now 
will be a tatter would weed of small worth hold 
then be ask where all pron1 beauty lie 
where all the treasure of pron1 lusty day 
to say within thine own deep sunken eye 
be an all eat shame and thriftless praise 
how much more praise deserv would thy beauty be use 
if pron1 couldst answer this fair child of mine 
shall sum pron1 count and make pron1 old excuse 
prove pron1 beauty by succession thine 
this be to be new make when pron1 art old 
and see pron1 blood warm when person1 feel ist pron1 cold 
iii 
look in pron1 glass and tell the face person1 person1 
now be the time that face should form another 
whose fresh repair if now thou not renew 
person1 pron1 beguile the person1 person1 some mother 
for where be pron1 so fair whose unear would womb 
disdain the tillage of pron1 husbandry 
or pron1 be pron1 so fond will be the tomb 
of pron1 self love to stop posterity 
thou art pron1 mother be glass and pron1 in pron1 
call back the lovely person1 of pron1 prime 
so thou through window of thine age shalt see 
despite of wrinkle this pron1 golden time 
but if pron1 live remember would not to be 
die single and thine image die with pron1 
iv 
person1 loveliness why dost thou spend 
upon pron1 pron1 beauty be legacy 
nature be bequest give pron1 but doth lend 
and be frank pron1 lend to those be free 
then beauteous person1 why dost person1 abuse 
the bounteous largess give pron1 to give 
person1 usurer why dost person1 use 
so great a sum of sum yet canst not live 
for have traffic with pron1 alone 
thou of pron1 pron1 sweet self pron1 deceive 
then how when nature call pron1 to be go 
what acceptable audit canst thou leave 
thy unused beauty must be tombe with pron1 
which use life th executor to be 
v 
those hour that with gentle work do frame 
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
will play the tyrant to the very same 
and that unfair which fairly doth excel 
for never rest time lead summer on 
to hideous winter and confound pron1 there 
person1 check with frost and lusty leave quite go 
beauty o er snow and bareness every where 
then be not summer be distillation leave 
a liquid prisoner pen in wall of glass 
beauty be effect with beauty be bereft 
nor pron1 nor no remembrance pron1 pron1 be 
but flower distill would though pron1 with winter meet 
person1 but pron1 show   pron1 substance still live sweet 
vi 
then let not winter be rag hand deface 
in pron1 pron1 summer ere person1 be distill would 
make sweet some vial   treasure thou some place 
with beauty be treasure ere pron1 be self kill would 
that use be not forbid usury 
which happie those pron1 pay the willing loan 
that be for pron1 to breed another thee 
or ordinal1 time happy be pron1 ordinal1 for ordinal1 
ordinal1 time pron1 be happy than thou art 
if ordinal1 of thine ordinal1 time person1 would pron1 
then pron1 could death do if pron1 shouldst depart 
leave pron1 live in posterity 
be not self will would for thou art much too fair 
to be death be conquest and make worm thine heir 
vii 
person1   in the orient when the gracious light 
lift up pron1 burn head each under eye 
person1 homage to pron1 new appearing sight 
serve with look pron1 sacred majesty 
and have climb would the steep up heavenly hill 
resemble strong youth in pron1 middle age 
yet mortal look adore pron1 beauty still 
attend on pron1 golden pilgrimage 
but when from highmost pitch with weary car 
like feeble age pron1 person1 from the day 
the eye fore duteous now convert be 
from pron1 low tract and look another way 
so thou pron1 outgoing in pron1 noon 
person1 would on di unless pron1 get a son 
person1 
music to hear why hear ist thou music sadly 
sweet with sweet war not joy delight in joy 
why person1 person1 thou that which person1 receiv person1 not gladly 
or else receiv ist with pleasure thine annoy 
if the true concord of well tune sound 
by union marry do offend thine ear 
pron1 do but sweetly chide pron1 pron1 confound 
in singleness the part pron1 thou shouldst bear 
person1 how ordinal1 string sweet husband to another 
strike each in each by mutual ordering 
resemble sire and child and happy mother 
pron1 all in ordinal1 ordinal1 pleasing note do sing 
whose speechless song be many seem one 
sing this to pron1 thou single wilt prove none   
ix 
be pron1 for fear to wet a widow be eye 
that person1 consum person1 pron1 in single life 
ah   if pron1 issueless shalt hap to die 
the world will wail pron1 like a makeless wife 
the world will be pron1 widow and still weep 
that thou no form of pron1 hast leave behind 
when every private widow well may keep 
by child be eye pron1 husband be shape in mind 
look   pron1 an unthrift in the world doth spend 
shift but pron1 place for still the world enjoy pron1 
but beauty be waste hath in the world an end 
and keep unused the user so destroy pron1 
no love toward other in that bosom sit 
that on pron1 such murd rous shame commit 
x 
for shame   deny pron1 thou bear ist love to any 
pron1 for pron1 art so unprovident 
person1 if pron1 wilt person1 art person1 would of many 
but that thou none person1 person1 be most evident 
for thou art so possess would with murderous hate 
that gainst pron1 thou stick person1 not to conspire 
seek that beauteous roof to ruinate 
which to repair should be pron1 chief desire 
o   change pron1 think that pron1 may change pron1 mind 
shall hate be fair person1 would than gentle love 
be as pron1 presence be gracious and kind 
or to pron1 at least kind hearted prove 
make pron1 another self for love of pron1 
that beauty still may live in thine or thee 
person1 
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast pron1 grow ist 
in ordinal1 of thine from that which person1 depart 
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow person1 
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convert 
herein live wisdom beauty and increase 
without this folly age and cold decay 
if all be minded so the time should cease 
and threescore year would make the world away 
let those pron1 nature hath not make for store 
person1 featureless and rude barrenly perish 
look pron1 pron1 good endow would pron1 give pron1 more 
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish 
pron1 carv would thee for pron1 seal and mean thereby 
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die 
xii 
when pron1 do count the clock pron1 tell the time 
and see the brave day sink in hideous night 
when pron1 behold the violet past prime 
and sable curl all silver o er with white 
when lofty tree pron1 see barren of leave 
which erst from heat do canopy the herd 
and summer be green all gird up in sheaf 
borne on the bi with white and bristly beard 
then of pron1 beauty do pron1 question make 
that person1 among the waste of time must go 
since sweet and beauty do pron1 forsake 
and die as fast as pron1 see other grow 
and pron1 gainst time be scythe can make defence 
save breed to brave pron1 when pron1 take pron1 hence 
xiii 
o   that pron1 be pron1 self   but love pron1 be 
no long pron1 than pron1 pron1 here live 
against this come end pron1 should prepare 
and pron1 sweet semblance to some other give 
so should that beauty which pron1 hold in lease 
find no determination   then pron1 be 
pron1 again after pron1 be decease 
when pron1 sweet issue pron1 sweet form should bear 
pron1 let so fair a house fall to decay 
which husbandry in honour might uphold 
against the stormy gust of winter be day 
and barren rage of death be eternal cold 
o   none but unthrifts   dear pron1 love pron1 know 
pron1 have a father let pron1 son say so 
person1 
not from the star do pron1 pron1 judgement pluck 
and yet methink pron1 have astronomy 
but not to tell of good or evil luck 
of plague of dearth or season quality 
nor can pron1 fortune to brief minute tell 
point to each pron1 thunder rain and wind 
or say with prince if pron1 shall go well 
by oft predict that pron1 in person1 find 
but from thine eye pron1 knowledge pron1 derive 
and constant star in pron1 pron1 read such art 
as truth and beauty shall together thrive 
if from pron1 to store person1 wouldst convert   
or else of pron1 this pron1 prognosticate 
  person1 end be truth be and beauty be doom and date   
person1 
when pron1 consider pron1 pron1 grow 
hold in perfection but a little moment 
that this huge stage person1 nought but show 
person1 the star in secret influence comment 
when pron1 perceive that man as plant increase 
cheer and check even by the self same sky 
person1 in pron1 youthful sap at height decrease 
and wear pron1 brave state out of memory 
then the conceit of this inconstant stay 
set pron1 most rich in youth before pron1 sight 
where wasteful time person1 with decay 
to change pron1 day of youth to sully night 
and all in war with time for love of pron1 
as pron1 take from pron1 pron1 engraft pron1 new 
xvi 
but wherefore do not pron1 a mighty way 
make war upon this bloody tyrant time 
and fortify pron1 in pron1 decay 
with mean more blessed than pron1 barren rhyme 
now stand pron1 on the top of happy hour 
and many maiden garden yet unset 
with virtuous wish would bear pron1 live flower 
much liker than pron1 paint counterfeit 
so should the line of life pron1 life repair 
which this time be pencil or pron1 pupil pen 
neither in inward worth nor outward fair 
can make pron1 live pron1 in eye of man 
to give away pron1 keep pron1 still 
and pron1 must live draw by pron1 own sweet skill 
person1 
pron1 will believe pron1 verse in time to come 
if pron1 be fill would with pron1 most high desert 
though yet person1 know pron1 be but as a tomb 
which hide pron1 life and show not half pron1 part 
if pron1 could write the beauty of pron1 eye 
and in fresh number number all pron1 grace 
the age to come would say this poet lie 
such heavenly touch person1 er touch would earthly face   
so should pron1 paper yellow would with pron1 age 
be scorn would like old man of less truth than tongue 
and pron1 true right be term would a poet be rage 
and stretch metre of an antique song 
but be some child of pron1 alive that time 
pron1 should live twice in pron1 and in pron1 rhyme 
person1 
shall pron1 compare pron1 to a summer be day 
thou art more lovely and more temperate 
rough wind do shake the darle bud of may 
and summer be lease hath all too short a date 
sometime too hot the eye of person1 shine 
and often be pron1 gold complexion dimm would 
and every fair from fair sometime decline 
by chance or nature be change course untrimm would 
but pron1 eternal summer shall not fade 
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow person1 
nor shall death brag person1 wander ist in pron1 shade 
when in eternal line to time person1 grow ist 
so long as man can breathe or eye can see 
so long live this and this give life to pron1 
person1 
devour time blunt thou the lion be paw 
and make the earth devour pron1 own sweet brood 
pluck the keen tooth from the fierce tiger be jaw 
and burn the long person1 would person1 in pron1 blood 
make glad and sorry season as thou fleet 
and do whate er pron1 wilt swift footed time 
to the wide world and all pron1 fade sweet 
but pron1 forbid pron1 ordinal1 most heinous crime 
o   carve not with pron1 hour pron1 love be fair brow 
nor draw no line there with thine antique pen 
pron1 in thy course untainted do allow 
for beauty be pattern to succeed man 
yet do pron1 bad old time   despite pron1 wrong 
pron1 love shall in pron1 verse ever live young 
xx 
a woman be face with nature be own hand paint 
person1 thou the master mistress of pron1 passion 
a woman be gentle heart but not acquaint 
with shift change as be false woman be fashion 
an eye more bright than pron1 less false in rolling 
gild the object whereupon pron1 gazeth 
a man in hue all hue in pron1 controlling 
which steal man be eye and woman be soul amazeth 
and for a woman wert person1 first create 
till nature as pron1 work person1 fall a doting 
and by addition pron1 of pron1 defeat 
by add ordinal1 thing to pron1 purpose pron1 
but since pron1 prick would thee out for woman be pleasure 
mine be pron1 love and pron1 love be use pron1 treasure 
xxi 
so be pron1 not with pron1 as with that muse 
person1 would by a paint beauty to pron1 verse 
pron1 heaven pron1 for ornament person1 use 
and every fair with pron1 fair doth rehearse 
make a couplement of proud compare 
with sun and moon with earth and sea be rich gem 
with person1 be first bear flower and all thing rare 
that person1 be air in this huge rondure hem 
o   let pron1 true in love but truly write 
and then believe pron1 pron1 love be as fair 
as any mother be child though not so bright 
as those gold candle fix would in person1 be air 
let pron1 say more that like of hearsay well 
pron1 will not praise that purpose not to sell 
xxii 
pron1 glass shall not persuade pron1 pron1 be old 
so long as youth and pron1 be of ordinal1 date 
but when in person1 time be furrow pron1 behold 
then look pron1 death pron1 day should expiate 
for all that beauty pron1 doth cover pron1 
be but the seemly raiment of pron1 heart 
which in pron1 breast doth live as thine in pron1 
how can pron1 then be eld than thou art 
o   therefore love be of pron1 so wary 
as pron1 not for pron1 but for pron1 will 
bear pron1 heart which pron1 will keep so person1 
as tender nurse pron1 babe from fare ill 
presume not on pron1 heart when mine be slay 
person1 person1 ist pron1 thine not to give back again 
person1 
as an unperfect actor on the stage 
pron1 with pron1 fear be put beside pron1 part 
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage 
whose strength be abundance weaken pron1 own heart 
so pron1 for fear of trust forget to say 
the perfect ceremony of love be rite 
and in mine own love be strength seem to decay 
o ercharg would with person1 of mine own love be might 
o   let pron1 look be then the eloquence 
and dumb presager of pron1 speak breast 
pron1 plead for love and look for recompense 
more than that tongue pron1 more hath more express would 
o   learn to read pron1 silent love hath writ 
to hear with eye belong to love be fine wit 
person1 
mine eye hath play would the painter and hath stell would 
thy beauty be form in table of pron1 heart 
pron1 body be the frame wherein person1 hold 
and perspective pron1 be good painter be art 
for through the painter must pron1 see pron1 skill 
to find where pron1 true image pictur would lie 
which in pron1 bosom be shop be hang still 
that hath pron1 window glaze with thine eye 
now see pron1 good turn eye for eye have do 
mine eye have draw pron1 shape and thine for pron1 
be window to pron1 breast where through the sun 
delight to peep to gaze therein on pron1 
yet eye this cunning want to grace pron1 art 
pron1 draw but pron1 pron1 see know not the heart 
xxv 
let those pron1 be in favour with pron1 star 
of public honour and proud title boast 
whilst pron1 pron1 fortune of such triumph bar 
person1 would for joy in that pron1 honour most 
great prince favourite pron1 fair leave spread 
but as the marigold at the sun be eye 
and in pron1 pron1 pride lie bury 
for at a frown pron1 in pron1 glory die 
the painful warrior famouse for fight 
after a ordinal1 victory once foil would 
be from the book of honour raze quite 
and all the rest forget for which pron1 toil would 
then happy pron1 pron1 love and be person1 would 
where pron1 may not remove nor be remov would 
xxvi 
person1 of pron1 love to pron1 in vassalage 
thy merit hath pron1 duty strongly knit 
to pron1 pron1 send this write embassage 
to witness duty not to show pron1 wit 
duty so great which wit so poor as mine 
may make seem bare in want word to show pron1 
but that pron1 hope some good conceit of thine 
in pron1 soul be think all naked will bestow pron1 
till whatsoever star pron1 guide pron1 moving 
point on pron1 graciously with fair aspect 
and put apparel on pron1 tatter would love 
to show pron1 worthy of pron1 sweet respect 
then may pron1 dare to boast how pron1 do love pron1 
till then not show pron1 head where thou mayst prove pron1 
person1 
person1 with toil pron1 haste pron1 to pron1 bed 
the dear respose for limb with person1 person1 would 
but then begin a journey in pron1 head 
to work pron1 mind when body be work be expire 
for then pron1 thought from far where pron1 abide 
intend a zealous pilgrimage to pron1 
and keep pron1 droop eyelid open wide 
look on darkness which the blind do see 
save that pron1 soul be imaginary sight 
present pron1 shadow to pron1 sightless view 
which like a jewel hang in ghastly night 
make black night beauteous and pron1 old face new 
person1   thus by day pron1 limb by night pron1 mind 
for pron1 and for pron1 no quiet find 
person1 
how can pron1 then return in happy plight 
that be debarre would the benefit of rest 
when day be oppression be not eas would by night 
but day by night and night by day oppress would 
and each though enemy to either be reign 
do in consent shake hand to torture pron1 
the one by toil the other to complain 
how far pron1 toil still far off from pron1 
pron1 tell the day to please pron1 thou art bright 
and dost pron1 grace when cloud do blot the person1 
so flatter pron1 the person1 complexion would night 
when sparkling star twire not thou person1 person1 the even 
but day doth daily draw pron1 sorrow long 
and night doth nightly make grief be length seem strong 
xxix 
when in disgrace with fortune and man be eye 
pron1 all alone beweep pron1 outcast state 
and trouble deaf heaven with pron1 bootless cry 
and look upon pron1 and curse pron1 fate 
wish pron1 like to ordinal1 more rich in hope 
featur would like pron1 like pron1 with friend possess would 
desire this man be art and that man be scope 
with pron1 pron1 most enjoy content least 
yet in these thought pron1 self almost despise 
haply pron1 think on pron1 and then pron1 state 
like to the lark at break of day arise 
from sullen earth sing hymn at person1 be gate 
for pron1 sweet love remember would such wealth bring 
that then pron1 scorn to change pron1 state with king 
xxx 
when to the session of sweet silent thought 
pron1 summon up remembrance of thing past 
pron1 sigh the lack of many a thing pron1 seek 
and with old woe new wail pron1 dear time be waste 
then can pron1 drown an eye unused to flow 
for precious friend hide in death be dateless night 
and weep afresh love be long since cancell would woe 
and moan the expense of many a vanish would sight 
then can pron1 grieve at grievance foregone 
and heavily from woe to woe tell o er 
the sad account of fore bemoan person1 
which pron1 new pay as if not pay before 
but if the while pron1 think on pron1 dear friend 
all loss be restor would and sorrow end 
xxxi 
person1 bosom be endear with all heart 
which pron1 by lack have suppose dead 
and pron1 reign love and all love be love part 
and all those friend which pron1 think bury 
how many a holy and obsequious tear 
person1 dear religious love person1 person1 from mine eye 
as interest of the dead which now appear 
but thing person1 would that hide in pron1 lie 
thou art the grave where bury love doth live 
person1 with the trophy of pron1 lover go 
pron1 all pron1 part of pron1 to pron1 do give 
that due of many now be thine alone 
pron1 image pron1 person1 would pron1 view in pron1 
and pron1 all pron1 hast all the all of pron1 for to pron1 sensual fault 
xxxii 
if pron1 survive pron1 well content day 
when that churl death pron1 bone with dust shall cover 
and shalt by fortune once more re survey 
these poor rude line of pron1 deceased lover 
compare pron1 with the person1 ring of the time 
and though pron1 be person1 would by every pen 
reserve pron1 for pron1 love not for pron1 rhyme 
exceed by the height of happy man 
o   then vouchsafe pron1 but this love think 
  have pron1 friend be muse grow with this grow age 
a dear birth than this pron1 love have bring 
to march in rank of well equipage 
but since pron1 die and poet well prove 
person1 for pron1 style pron1 will read pron1 for pron1 love   
person1 
full many a glorious morning have pron1 see 
flatter the mountain top with sovereign eye 
kiss with golden face the meadow green 
gilding pale stream with heavenly alchemy 
person1 permit the base cloud to ride 
with ugly rack on pron1 celestial face 
and from the forlorn world pron1 visage hide 
steal unseen to west with this disgrace 
even so pron1 sun ordinal1 early morn do shine 
with all triumphant splendour on pron1 brow 
but out   person1   pron1 be but ordinal1 hour mine 
the region person1 person1 mask would pron1 from pron1 now 
yet pron1 for this pron1 love no whit person1 
sun of the world may stain when person1 be sun person1 
person1 
why didst person1 promise such a beauteous day 
and make pron1 travel forth without pron1 cloak 
to let base cloud o ertake pron1 in pron1 way 
hide pron1 bravery in pron1 rotten smoke 
  pron1 not enough that through the cloud person1 break 
to dry the rain on pron1 storm beat face 
for no man well of such a salve can speak 
that heal the wound and cure not the disgrace 
nor can pron1 shame give physic to pron1 grief 
though thou repent yet pron1 have still the loss 
the offender be sorrow lend but weak relief 
to pron1 pron1 bear the strong offence be cross 
ah   but those tear be pearl which pron1 love shed 
and pron1 be rich and ransom all ill deed 
xxxv 
no more be person1 would at that which person1 hast do 
rose have thorn and silver fountain mud 
cloud and eclipse stain both moon and sun 
and loathsome canker live in sweetest bud 
all man make fault and even pron1 in this 
authorize pron1 trespass with compare 
pron1 corrupt salve pron1 amiss 
excuse pron1 sin more than pron1 sin be 
for to pron1 sensual fault pron1 bring in sense 
thy adverse party be pron1 advocate 
and gainst pron1 a lawful plea commence 
such civil war be in pron1 love and hate 
that pron1 an accessary need must be 
to that sweet thief which sourly rob from pron1 
xxxvi 
let pron1 confess that pron1 ordinal1 must be twain 
although pron1 undivided love be ordinal1 
so shall those blot pron1 do with pron1 remain 
without thy help by pron1 be bear alone 
in pron1 ordinal1 love pron1 be but ordinal1 respect 
though in pron1 life a separable spite 
which though pron1 alter not love be sole effect 
yet doth pron1 steal sweet hour from love be delight 
pron1 may not evermore acknowledge pron1 
lest pron1 bewail guilt should do pron1 shame 
nor thou with public kindness honour pron1 
unless thou take that honour from pron1 name 
but do not so pron1 love pron1 in such sort 
as thou be mine mine be pron1 good report 
person1 
as a decrepit father take delight 
to see pron1 active child do deed of youth 
so pron1 make lame by fortune be dear spite 
take all pron1 comfort of pron1 worth and truth 
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit 
or any of these all or all or more 
entitle in thy part do crown sit 
pron1 make pron1 love engraft to this store 
so then pron1 be not lame poor nor person1 would 
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give 
that pron1 in thy abundance be suffic would 
and by a part of all pron1 glory live 
look pron1 be good that well pron1 wish in pron1 
this wish pron1 have   then ordinal1 time happy pron1 
person1 
how can pron1 muse want subject to invent 
while thou dost breathe pron1 pour ist into pron1 verse 
thine own sweet argument too excellent 
for every vulgar paper to rehearse 
o   give pron1 the thank if aught in pron1 
worthy perusal stand against pron1 sight 
for pron1 be so dumb pron1 can not write to pron1 
when thou pron1 dost give invention light 
be thou the tenth muse ordinal1 time more in worth 
than those old ordinal1 which rhymer invocate 
and pron1 pron1 call on pron1 let pron1 bring forth 
eternal number to outlive long date 
if pron1 slight muse do please these curious day 
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise 
person1 
o   how pron1 worth with manner may pron1 sing 
when pron1 art all the well part of pron1 
pron1 can mine own praise to pron1 own self bring 
and pron1 be not but mine own when pron1 praise pron1 
even for this let pron1 divide live 
and pron1 dear love lose name of single one 
that by this separation pron1 may give 
that due to pron1 which person1 deserv person1 alone 
o absence   pron1 a torment wouldst person1 prove 
be pron1 not pron1 sour leisure give sweet leave 
to entertain the time with thought of love 
which time and thought so sweetly doth deceive 
and that person1 teachest how to make ordinal1 twain 
by praise pron1 here pron1 doth hence remain 
person1 
take all my love pron1 love yea take pron1 all 
pron1 hast person1 then more than thou hadst before 
no love pron1 love pron1 thou mayst true love call 
all mine be thine before thou hadst this more 
then if for pron1 love thou pron1 love person1 
pron1 can not blame pron1 for pron1 love person1 us 
but yet be blam would if person1 pron1 deceivest 
by wilful taste of pron1 pron1 refusest 
pron1 do forgive pron1 robbery gentle thief 
although pron1 steal pron1 all pron1 poverty 
and yet love know pron1 be a great grief 
to bear love be wrong than hate be know injury 
lascivious grace in pron1 all ill well show 
kill pron1 with spite yet pron1 must not be foe 
person1 
those pretty wrong pron1 liberty commit 
when pron1 be sometime absent from pron1 heart 
thy beauty and pron1 year full well befit 
for still temptation follow where thou art 
gentle thou art and therefore to be win 
beauteous thou art therefore to be assail would 
and when a woman woo pron1 woman be son 
will sourly leave pron1 till pron1 have prevail would 
ay pron1   but yet person1 mightst pron1 seat forbear 
and chide pron1 beauty and pron1 stray youth 
pron1 lead pron1 in pron1 riot even there 
where thou art force to break a twofold truth 
her by pron1 beauty tempt pron1 to pron1 
thine by pron1 beauty be false to pron1 
person1 
that pron1 hast pron1 pron1 be not all pron1 grief 
and yet pron1 may be say pron1 love pron1 dearly 
that pron1 hath pron1 be of pron1 wail chief 
a loss in love pron1 touch pron1 more nearly 
love offender thus pron1 will excuse pron1 
thou dost love pron1 because pron1 know ist pron1 love pron1 
and for pron1 sake even so doth pron1 abuse pron1 
suffer pron1 friend for pron1 sake to approve pron1 
if pron1 lose pron1 pron1 loss be pron1 love be gain 
and lose pron1 pron1 friend hath find that loss 
both find each other and pron1 lose both twain 
and both for pron1 sake lie on pron1 this cross 
but here be the joy   pron1 friend and pron1 be ordinal1 
sweet flattery   then pron1 love but pron1 alone 
person1 
when most pron1 wink then do mine eye well see 
for all the day pron1 view thing unrespected 
but when pron1 sleep in dream pron1 look on pron1 
and darkly bright be bright in dark direct 
then thou whose shadow shadow doth make bright 
how would pron1 shadow be form form happy show 
to the clear day with pron1 much clear light 
when to unseee eye pron1 shade shine so 
how would pron1 say mine eye be bless make 
by look on pron1 in the living day 
when in dead night pron1 fair imperfect shade 
through heavy sleep on sightless eye doth stay 
all day be night to see till pron1 see pron1 
and night bright day when dream do show pron1 pron1 
xliv 
if the dull substance of pron1 flesh be think 
injurious distance should not stop pron1 way 
for then despite of space pron1 would be bring 
from limit far remote where thou dost stay 
no matter then although pron1 foot do stand

by those swift messenger return would from pron1

mine eye and heart be at a mortal war 
how to divide the conquest of pron1 sight 
mine eye pron1 heart pron1 picture be sight would bar 
pron1 heart mine eye the freedom of that right 
pron1 heart doth plead that person1 in pron1 dost lie 
a closet never pierce with crystal eye 
but the defendant doth that plea deny 
and say in pron1 pron1 fair appearance lie 
to side this title be impannelle 
a quest of thought all tenant to the heart

the clear eye be moiety and the dear heart be part 
as thus   mine eye be due be pron1 outward part 
and pron1 heart be right pron1 inward love of heart

betwixt mine eye and heart a league be take

another time mine eye be pron1 heart be guest

so either by pron1 picture or pron1 love 
person1 away art present still with pron1

how careful be pron1 when pron1 take pron1 way 
each trifle under true bar to thrust 
that to pron1 use pron1 might unused stay

most worthy comfort now pron1 great grief 
person1 good of dear and mine only care

when love convert from the thing pron1 be 
shall reason find of settle gravity 
against that time do pron1 ensconce pron1 here 
within the knowledge of mine own desert 
and this pron1 hand against pron1 self uprear 
to guard the lawful reason on pron1 part 
to leave poor pron1 thou hast the strength of law 
since why to love pron1 can allege no cause

how heavy do pron1 journey on the way

pron1 rider person1 would not speed be make from pron1 
the bloody spur can not provoke pron1 on 
that sometimes anger thrust into pron1 hide 
which heavily pron1 answer with a groan 
more sharp to pron1 than spur to pron1 side 
for that same groan doth put this in pron1 mind 
pron1 grief lie onward and pron1 joy behind 
person1 
thus can pron1 love excuse the slow offence 
of pron1 dull bearer when from pron1 pron1 speed 
from where thou art why should pron1 haste pron1 thence 
till pron1 return of posting be no need 
o   what excuse will pron1 poor beast then find 
when swift extremity can seem but slow 
then should pron1 spur though mount on the wind 
in winged speed no motion shall pron1 know 
then can no horse with pron1 desire keep pace 
therefore desire of perfect ist love be make 
shall neigh no dull flesh in pron1 fiery race

a crow pron1 fly in person1 be sweetest air

no long mourn for pron1 when pron1 be dead

nay if pron1 read this line remember not 
the hand pron1 writ pron1 for pron1 love pron1 so 
that pron1 in pron1 sweet thought would be forget 
if think on pron1 then should make pron1 woe 
o if pron1 say pron1 look upon this verse 
when pron1 perhaps compound be with clay 
do not so much as pron1 poor name rehearse 
but let pron1 love even with pron1 life decay 
lest the wise world should look into pron1 moan 
and mock pron1 with pron1 after pron1 be go

o   lest the world should task pron1 to recite 
pron1 merit live in pron1 that pron1 should love 
after pron1 death dear love forget pron1 quite 
for pron1 in pron1 can pron1 worthy prove 
unless pron1 would devise some virtuous lie 
to do more for pron1 than mine own desert 
and hang more praise upon deceased pron1 
than niggard truth would willingly impart 
o   lest pron1 true love may seem false in this 
that pron1 for love speak well of pron1 untrue 
pron1 name be bury where pron1 body be 
and live no more to shame nor pron1 nor pron1 
for pron1 be shame by that which pron1 bring forth 
and so should pron1 to love thing pron1 worth 
person1 
that time of year thou mayst in pron1 behold 
when yellow leave or none or few do hang 
upon those bough which shake against the cold 
bare ruin would choir where late the sweet bird sing 
in pron1 thou see ist the twilight of such day 
as after sunset fadeth in the west 
which by and by black night doth take away 
death be second self pron1 seal up all in rest 
in pron1 thou see ist the glowing of such fire 
that on the ashe of pron1 youth doth lie

person1 would with that which pron1 be nourish would by 
this person1 person1 person1 which make pron1 love more strong 
to love that well which person1 must leave ere long 
person1 
but be content when that fall arrest 
without all bail shall carry pron1 away 
pron1 life hath in this line some interest 
which for memorial still with pron1 shall stay 
when pron1 reviewest this thou dost review 
the very part be consecrate to pron1 
the earth can have but earth which be pron1 due 
pron1 spirit be thine the well part of pron1 
so then pron1 hast but lose the dreg of life 
the prey of worm pron1 body be dead 
the coward conquest of a wretch be knife 
too base of pron1 to be remember 
the worth of that be that which pron1 contain 
and that be this and this with person1 remain 
lxxv 
so be pron1 to pron1 thought as food to life 
or as sweet season would shower be to the ground 
and for the peace of pron1 pron1 hold such strife 
as person1 a miser and pron1 wealth be find 
now proud as an enjoyer and person1 
doubt the filch age will steal pron1 treasure 
now count well to be with pron1 alone 
then well would that the world may see pron1 pleasure 
sometime all full with feasting on pron1 sight 
and by and by clean starve for a look 
possess or pursue no delight

thus do pron1 pine and surfeit day by day

why be pron1 verse so barren of new pride 
so far from variation or quick change 
why with the time do pron1 not glance aside 
to new find method and to compound strange 
why write pron1 still all ordinal1 ever the same

that every word doth almost tell pron1 name 
show pron1 birth and where pron1 do proceed

and pron1 and love be still pron1 argument 
so all pron1 good be dress old word new 
spend again pron1 be already spend

those child nurse deliver would from pron1 brain 
to take a new acquaintance of pron1 mind 
these office so oft as thou wilt look 
shall profit pron1 and much enrich person1 book 
person1 
so oft have pron1 invoke pron1 for pron1 muse 
and find such fair assistance in pron1 verse 
as every alien pen person1 get pron1 use

have add feather to the learn be wing

as high as learn pron1 rude ignorance

pron1 verse alone have all pron1 gentle grace

pron1 rob pron1 of and pay pron1 thee again 
pron1 lend pron1 virtue and pron1 steal that word 
from pron1 behaviour   person1 doth pron1 give

since pron1 pron1 owe pron1 thou pron1 dost pay 
lxxx 
o   how pron1 faint when pron1 of pron1 do write 
know a well spirit doth use pron1 name

the humble as the proud sail doth bear 
pron1 saucy bark inferior far to pron1 
on pron1 broad main doth wilfully appear 
pron1 shallow help will hold pron1 up afloat 
whilst pron1 upon pron1 soundless deep person1 ride

how far a modern quill doth come too short

this silence for pron1 sin pron1 do impute 
which shall be most pron1 glory be dumb

which should example where pron1 equal grow

that to pron1 subject lend not some small glory 
but pron1 pron1 write of pron1 if pron1 can tell 
that pron1 be pron1 so dignify pron1 story 
let pron1 but copy pron1 in pron1 be writ

and like unlettered clerk still cry amen 
to every hymn pron1 able spirit afford 
in polish would form of well refined pen 
hear pron1 praise pron1 say notis so notis true

but that be in pron1 thought whose love to pron1

pron1 for pron1 dumb thought speak in effect 
lxxxvi 
be pron1 the proud full sail of pron1 great verse

above a mortal pitch pron1 strike pron1 dead 
no neither pron1 nor pron1 compeer by night 
give pron1 aid pron1 verse astonished 
pron1 nor that affable familiar ghost

lxxxix 
say that pron1 didst forsake pron1 for some fault 
and pron1 will comment upon that offence 
speak of pron1 lameness and pron1 straight will halt 
against thy reason make no defence 
thou canst not love disgrace pron1 half so ill 
to set a form upon desire change 
as pron1 will pron1 disgrace   know person1 will 
pron1 will acquaintance strangle and look strange 
be absent from pron1 walk   and in pron1 tongue 
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell 
person1 pron1 too much profane should do pron1 wrong 
and haply of pron1 old acquaintance tell 
for pron1 against pron1 self pron1 will vow debate 
for pron1 must person1 er love pron1 pron1 thou dost hate 
person1 
then hate pron1 when pron1 wilt   if ever now 
now while the world be bent pron1 deed to cross 
join with the spite of fortune make pron1 bow 
and do not drop in for an after loss 
ah   do not when pron1 heart hath iscap would this sorrow 
come in the rearward of a conquer would woe 
give not a windy night a rainy morrow 
to linger out a purpos would overthrow 
if pron1 wilt leave pron1 do not leave pron1 last 
when other petty grief have do pron1 spite 
but in the onset come so shall pron1 taste 
at first the very bad of fortune be might 
and other strain of woe which now seem woe

some glory in pron1 birth some in pron1 skill

all these pron1 well in ordinal1 general good 
thy love be well than high birth to pron1

wretche in this alone pron1 thou mayst take 
all this away and pron1 most wretched make 
person1 
but do pron1 bad to steal pron1 away 
for term of life person1 art assure pron1 
and life no long than pron1 love will stay 
for pron1 depend upon that love of thine 
then need pron1 not to fear the bad of wrong 
when in the least of pron1 pron1 life hath end 
pron1 see a well state to pron1 belong

thou canst not vex pron1 with inconstant mind 
since that pron1 life on pron1 revolt doth lie 
o   pron1 a happy title do pron1 find 
happy to have pron1 love happy to die 
but pron1 be so blessed fair pron1 fear no blot 
thou mayst be false and yet pron1 know pron1 not

so shall pron1 live suppose person1 art true 
like a deceive husband   so love be face 
may still seem love to pron1 though alter would new 
thy look with pron1 pron1 heart in other place 
for pron1 can live no hatred in thine eye 
therefore in that pron1 can not know pron1 change 
in many be look the false heart be history

but person1 in pron1 creation do decree 
that in pron1 face sweet love should ever dwell 
person1 er pron1 thought or pron1 heart be working be 
thy look should pron1 thence but sweetness tell 
how like eve be apple doth pron1 beauty grow 
if pron1 sweet virtue answer not pron1 show

and husband nature be rich from expense 
pron1 be the lord and owner of pron1 face

the hard knife ill pron1 would doth lose pron1 edge

some say pron1 grace be youth and gentle sport 
both grace and fault be person1 would of more and less 
person1 person1 person1 fault grace that to pron1 resort

so be those error pron1 in pron1 be see

how many lamb might the stern person1 betray 
if like a lamb pron1 could pron1 look translate 
how many gazer mightst thou lead away

how like a winter hath pron1 absence be

what freezing have pron1 feel pron1 dark day see 
pron1 old person1 be bareness everywhere

like widow would womb after pron1 lord decease

but hope of orphan and unfather would fruit 
for summer and pron1 pleasure wait on pron1 
and thou away the very bird be mute 
or if pron1 sing person1 with so dull a cheer 
that leave look pale dread the winter be near 
person1 
from pron1 have pron1 be absent in the spring 
when proud pie person1 dress would in all pron1 trim 
person1 put a spirit of youth in every thing 
that heavy saturn laugh would and leap would with pron1 
yet nor the lay of bird nor the sweet smell 
of different flower in odour and in hue 
could make pron1 any summer be story tell 
or from pron1 proud lap pluck pron1 where pron1 grow 
nor do pron1 wonder at the lily be white 
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 
pron1 be but sweet but figure of delight

ordinal1 blushing shame another white despair 
a third nor red nor person1 have person1 person1 of both 
and to pron1 robbery have person1 would thy breath 
but for pron1 theft in pride of all pron1 growth 
a vengeful canker eat pron1 up to death 
more flower pron1 note yet pron1 none could see 
but sweet or colour pron1 have person1 person1 from pron1

where art person1 muse that person1 forget ist so long 
to speak of that which give pron1 all pron1 might 
spend ist pron1 pron1 fury on some worthless song 
darken pron1 power to lend base subject light 
return forgetful muse and straight redeem 
in gentle number time so idly spend 
sing to the ear pron1 doth person1 lay esteem 
and give pron1 pen both skill and argument 
rise resty muse pron1 love be sweet face survey 
if time have any wrinkle graven there 
if any be a satire to decay

give pron1 love fame fast than time waste life 
so thou prevent person1 pron1 scythe and crooked knife

o truant muse pron1 shall be pron1 amend 
for pron1 neglect of truth in beauty person1 would 
both truth and beauty on pron1 love depend 
so dost person1 too and therein dignified 
make answer muse wilt pron1 not haply say 
  truth need no colour with pron1 colour fix would 
beauty no pencil beauty be truth to lay 
but good be good if never intermix would   
because pron1 need no praise wilt thou be dumb 
excuse not silence so for not lie in thee 
to make pron1 much outlive a gilded tomb 
and to be person1 would of age yet to be 
then do pron1 office muse   pron1 teach pron1 how 
to make pron1 seem long hence as pron1 show now 
cii 
pron1 love be strengthen would though more weak in seeming 
pron1 love not less though less the show appear 
that love be merchandiz would whose rich esteeming 
the owner be tongue person1 publish every where 
pron1 love be new and then but in the spring 
when pron1 be will not to greet pron1 with pron1 lay 
as philomel in summer be front doth sing 
and stop pron1 pipe in growth of riper day 
not that the summer be less pleasant now 
than when pron1 mournful hymn do hush the night 
but that wild music burthen every bough 
and sweet grow common lose pron1 dear delight 
therefore like pron1 pron1 sometime hold pron1 tongue 
because pron1 would not dull pron1 with pron1 song 
person1 
alack   what poverty pron1 muse bring forth 
that have such a scope to show pron1 pride 
the argument all bare be of more worth 
than when pron1 hath pron1 add praise beside 
o   blame pron1 not if pron1 no more can write 
look in pron1 glass and pron1 appear a face 
that over go pron1 blunt invention quite 
dull pron1 line and do pron1 disgrace 
be pron1 not sinful then strive to mend 
to mar the subject that before be well

to pron1 fair friend pron1 never can be old 
for as pron1 be when first pron1 eye pron1 ey would

have from the forest shake ordinal1 summer pride 
ordinal1 beauteous spring to yellow autumn turn would 
in process of the season have pron1 see 
ordinal1 person1 perfume in ordinal1 hot june burn would 
since first pron1 see pron1 fresh which yet be green 
ah   yet doth beauty like a dial hand 
steal from pron1 figure and no pace perceiv would 
so pron1 sweet hue which methink still doth stand 
person1 motion and mine eye may be deceiv would 
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred 
person1 pron1 be bear be beauty be summer dead

let not pron1 love be call would idolatry 
nor pron1 beloved as an idol show 
since all alike pron1 song and praise be 
to ordinal1 of ordinal1 still such and ever so 
person1 be pron1 love to day to morrow person1 
still constant in a wondrous excellence 
therefore pron1 verse to constancy person1 would 
ordinal1 thing express leave out difference 
  fair kind and true be all pron1 argument 
  fair kind and true vary to other word 
and in this change be pron1 invention spend 
ordinal1 theme in ordinal1 which wondrous scope afford

when in the chronicle of waste time

in praise of lady dead and lovely knight 
then in the blazon of sweet beauty be good 
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow 
pron1 see pron1 antique pen would have express would 
even such a beauty as pron1 master now 
so all pron1 praise be but prophecy 
of this pron1 time all pron1 prefigure 
and for pron1 look but with divine eye 
pron1 have not skill enough pron1 worth to sing 
for pron1 which now behold these present day 
have eye to wonder but lack tongue to praise 
person1 
not pron1 own fear nor the prophetic soul 
of the wide world dream on thing to come 
can yet the lease of pron1 true love control 
suppose as person1 to a person1 would doom 
the mortal moon hath pron1 eclipse person1 would 
and the sad person1 mock pron1 own presage 
person1 now crown pron1 person1 would 
and peace proclaim olive of endless age 
now with the drop of this most balmy time 
pron1 love look fresh and death to pron1 subscribes 
since spite of pron1 pron1 will live in this poor rime 
while pron1 insult o er dull and speechless tribe 
and thou in this shalt find pron1 monument 
when tyrant crest and tomb of brass be spend 
person1 
pron1 be in the brain pron1 ink may character 
which hath not figur would to thee pron1 true spirit 
pron1 be new to speak pron1 now to register 
that may express pron1 love or pron1 dear merit 
pron1 sweet boy   but yet like prayer divine 
pron1 must each day say o er the very same 
count no old thing old person1 mine pron1 thine 
even as when first pron1 hallow would thy fair name 
so that eternal love in love be fresh case 
weigh not the dust and injury of age 
nor give to necessary wrinkle place 
but make antiquity for aye pron1 page 
find the first conceit of love there breed 
where time and outward form would show pron1 dead

though absence seem would pron1 flame to qualify 
as easy might pron1 from pron1 self depart 
as from pron1 soul which in pron1 breast doth lie 
that be pron1 home of love if pron1 have ring would 
like pron1 pron1 travel pron1 return again

so that pron1 bring water for pron1 stain

most true pron1 be that pron1 have look would on truth 
person1 and strangely   but by all above 
these blenche give pron1 heart another youth 
and bad essay person1 would thee pron1 good of love 
now all be do save pron1 shall have no end
