speak by prospero 
now pron1 charm be all o erthrown 
and what strength pron1 have be pron1 own 
which be most faint now notis true 
pron1 must be here confine by pron1 
or send to person1   let pron1 not 
since pron1 have pron1 dukedom get 
and person1 would the deceiver person1 
in this bare island by pron1 spell 
but release pron1 from pron1 band 
with the help of pron1 good hand 
gentle breath of pron1 pron1 sail 
must fill or else pron1 project fail 
which be to please   now pron1 want 
spirit to enforce art to enchant 
and pron1 ending be despair 
unless pron1 be relieve by prayer 
which pierce so that pron1 assault 
mercy pron1 and free all fault 
as pron1 from crime would pardon would be 
let pron1 indulgence set pron1 free
