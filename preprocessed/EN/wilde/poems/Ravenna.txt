a year ago pron1 breathe the italian air 
and yet methink this northern spring be fair 
these field make golden with the flower of person1 
the throstle singing on the feather larch 
the caw rook the wood dove flutter by 
the little cloud pron1 race across the sky 
and fair the violet be gentle droop head 
the primrose pale for love uncomforte 
the rose that burgeon on the climb briar 
the crocus bed pron1 seem a moon of fire 
person1 girdle with a purple marriage ring   
and all the flower of pron1 english spring 
fond snowdrop and the bright star daffodil 
up start the lark beside the murmur mill 
and break the gossamer thread of early dew 
and down the river like a flame of blue 
person1 as an arrow fly the water king 
while the brown linnet in the person1 sing 
a year ago   pron1 seem a little time 
since last pron1 see that lordly southern clime 
where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow 
and like bright lamp the fabled apple glow 
full spring pron1 be and by rich flowering vine 
dark olive grove and noble forest pine 
pron1 ride at will   the moist glad air be sweet 
the white road ring beneath pron1 horse be foot 
and muse on person1 be ancient name 
pron1 watch the day till mark with wound of flame 
the turquoise sky to burnish gold be turn 

o how pron1 heart with boyish passion burn 
when far away across the sedge and mere 
pron1 see that holy city rise clear 
crown with pron1 crown of tower   on and on 
pron1 gallop race with the set sun 
and ere the crimson after glow be pass 
pron1 stand within person1 be wall at last 

person1 

how strangely still   no sound of life or joy 
startle the air   no laugh shepherd boy 
pipe on pron1 reed nor ever through the day 
come the glad sound of child at pron1 play 
o sad and sweet and silent   surely here 
a man might dwell apart from troublous fear 
watch the tide of season as pron1 flow 
from amorous spring to winter be rain and snow 
and have no thought of sorrow   here indeed 
be lethe be water and that fatal weed 
which make a man forget pron1 fatherland 

ay   amid person1 meadow dost person1 stand 
like proserpine with person1 person1 head 
guard the holy ashe of the dead 
for though pron1 brood of warrior son hath cease 
thy noble dead be with pron1   pron1 at least 
be faithful to thine honour guard pron1 well 
o childless city   for a mighty spell 
to wake man be heart to dream of thing sublime 
be the lone tomb where rest the great of time 

iii 

person1 lonely pillar rise on the plain 
mark where the brave knight of person1 be slay 
the prince of person1 the person1 of war 
person1 person1 person1 for some untimely star 
lead pron1 against pron1 city and pron1 fall 
as fall some forest lion fight well 
take from life while life and love be new 
pron1 lie beneath person1 be seamless veil of blue 
tall lance like reed wave sadly o er pron1 head 
and oleander bloom to deep red 
where pron1 bright youth flow crimson on the ground 

look far north unto that broken mound 
pron1 prisone now within a lordly tomb 
raise by a daughter be hand in lonely gloom 
huge limbe theodoric the gothic king 
sleep after all pron1 weary conquering 
time hath not spare pron1 ruin wind and rain 
have break down pron1 stronghold   and again 
pron1 see that death be mighty lord of all 
and king and clown to ashen dust must fall 

mighty indeed pron1 glory   yet to pron1 
barbaric king or knight of person1 
or the great queen pron1 be poor and vain 
beside the grave where person1 rest from pain 
pron1 gilded shrine lie open to the air 
and cunning sculptor be hand have carven there 
the calm white brow as calm as early morn 
the eye pron1 flash with passionate love and scorn 
the lip pron1 sing of person1 and of hell 
the almond face which giotto draw so well 
the weary face of person1   to this day 
here in pron1 place of rest far away 
from arno be yellow water rush down 
through the wide bridge of that fairy town 
where the tall tower of giotto seem to rise 
a marble lily under sapphire sky 

alas   pron1 dante   person1 hast know the pain 
of mean life the exile be gall chain 
how steep the stair within king house be 
and all the petty misery which mar 
man be noble nature with the sense of wrong 
yet this dull world be grateful for pron1 song 
pron1 nation do pron1 homage even pron1 
that cruel queen of vine clothe tuscany 
pron1 bind with crown of thorn pron1 live brow 
person1 deck thine empty tomb with laurel now 
and beg in vain the ashe of pron1 son 

o mighty exile   all pron1 grief be do

person1 guard thine ashe sleep in peace 

iv 

how lone this palace be   how grey the wall 
no minstrel now wake echo in these hall 
the broken chain lie rust on the door 
and noisome weed have split the marble floor 
here lurk the snake and here the lizard run 
by the stone lion blink in the sun 
person1 dwelt here in love and revelry 
for ordinal1 long year a second person1 
pron1 of the world another actium make 
yet suffer not pron1 royal soul to fade 
or person1 to break or lance to grow less keen 
  neath any wile of an egyptian queen 
for from the east there come a mighty cry 
and person1 stand up to fight for liberty 
and call pron1 from person1 never knight 
rode forth more nobly to wild scene of fight 
none fall more bravely on person1 field 
borne like a spartan back upon pron1 shield 
o hellas   person1   in thine hour of pride 
thy day of might remember pron1 pron1 die 
to wrest from off pron1 limb the trammelle chain 
o person1   o lone person1 plain 
o toss wave of person1 person1 sea 
o wind sweep height of person1 person1 
pron1 love pron1 well ay not alone in word 
pron1 freely give to pron1 pron1 lyre and sword 
like Ã¦schylo at well fight marathon 

and person1 too shall glory in pron1 son 
pron1 warrior poet first in song and fight 
no long now shall slander be venomed spite 
crawl like a snake across pron1 perfect name 
or person1 the lordly scutcheon of pron1 fame 

for as the olive garland of the race 
which light with joy each eager runner be face 
as the person1 person1 which person1 man in war 
as a flame bearded beacon see from far 
by mariner upon a storm toss sea 
such be pron1 love for person1 and person1 

person1 thy crown be ever fresh and green 
red leave of rise from sapphic mitylene 
shall bind pron1 brow   the myrtle bloom for pron1 
in hidden glade by lonely person1 
the laurel wait pron1 come all be thine 
and round pron1 head ordinal1 perfect wreath will twine 

v 

the pine top rock before the evening breeze 
with the hoarse murmur of the person1 person1 
and the tall stem be streak with amber bright   
pron1 wander through the wood in wild delight 
some startle bird with flutter wing and fleet 
make snow of all the blossom   at pron1 foot 
like silver crown the pale narcissi lie 
and small bird sing on every twining spray 
o wave tree o forest liberty 
within pron1 haunt at least a man be free 
and half forget the weary world of strife 
the blood flow hotter and a sense of life 
wake pron1 the quicken vein while once again 
the wood be fill with god pron1 fancy slay 
long time pron1 watch and surely hope to see 
some goat foot person1 make merry minstrelsy 
amid the reed   some startle dryad maid 
in girlish flight   or lurk in the glade 
the soft brown limb the wanton treacherous face 
of woodland person1   person1 person1 in the chase 
white limbe and terrible with look of pride 
and leash of boar hound leap at pron1 side 
or hyla mirror in the perfect stream 

o idle heart   o fond hellenic dream 
person1 long with melancholy rise and swell 
the evening chime the convent be vesper bell 
strike on mine ear amid the amorous flower 
alas   alas   these sweet and honied hour 
have whelm pron1 heart like some encroach sea 
and drown all thought of black gethsemane 

person1 

o person1 person1   many a tale be tell 
of pron1 great glory in the day of old 
ordinal1 ordinal1 year have pass since person1 didst see 
person1 ride forth to royal victory 
person1 pron1 name when person1 be lean eagle fly 
from person1 be isle to far person1 blue 
and of the people thou wast noble queen 
till in thy street the goth and person1 be see 
discrowne by man desert by the sea 
person1 sleepest rock in lonely misery 
no long now upon thy swell tide 
pine forest like pron1 myriad galley ride 
for where the brass beak ship be will not to float 
the weary shepherd pipe pron1 mournful note 
and the white sheep be free to come and go 
where person1 be purple water use to flow 

o fair   o sad   person1 queen person1 
in ruined loveliness person1 li dead 
alone of all pron1 sister   for at last 
person1 be royal warrior hath pass 
person1 be lordly entrance and hath wear pron1 crown 
in the high temple of the eternal town 
the palatine hath welcome back pron1 king 
and with pron1 name the ordinal1 mountain ring 

and person1 hath outlive pron1 dream of pain 
and mock pron1 tyrant   person1 live again 
person1 rise from the water   and the cry 
of light and truth of love and liberty 
be hear in lordly genoa and where 
the marble spire of person1 wind the air 
ring from the alp to the person1 person1 
and person1 be dream be now a dream no more 

but person1 person1 well love than all 
thy ruin palace be but a pall 
that hide pron1 fall greatness   and pron1 name 
person1 like a grey and flicker candle flame 
beneath the noonday splendour of the sun 
of new italia   for the night be do 
the night of dark oppression and the day 
person1 dawn in passionate splendour far away 
the austrian hound be hunt from the land 
beyond those ice crown citadel which stand 
girdle the plain of royal lombardy 
from the far west unto the eastern sea 

pron1 know indeed that son of thine have die 
in lissa be water by the mountain side 
of aspromonte on person1 be plain 
nor have pron1 child die for pron1 in vain 
and yet methink person1 hast not drunk this wine 
from grape new crush of liberty divine 
person1 hast not follow that immortal star 
which lead the people forth to deed of war 
weary of life thou liest in silent sleep 
as ordinal1 pron1 mark the lengthen shadow creep 
careless of all the hurrying hour pron1 run 
mourn some day of glory for the sun 
of freedom hath not shew to pron1 pron1 face 
and pron1 hast catch no flambeau in the race 

yet wake not from pron1 slumber rest pron1 well 
amidst pron1 field of amber person1 
thy lily sprinkle meadow rest pron1 there 
to mock all human greatness pron1 would dare 
to vent the paltry sorrow of pron1 life 
before pron1 ruin or to praise the strife 
of king ambition and the barren pride 
of war nation   person1 not thou the bride 
of the wild person1 of person1 be stormy sea 
the queen of double empire   and to pron1 
be not the nation give as pron1 prey 
and now pron1 gate lie open night and day 
the grass grow green on every tower and hall 
the ghastly fig hath cleft person1 bastione wall 
and where person1 mailÃ¨d warrior stand at rest 
the midnight owl person1 make pron1 secret nest 
o fall   fallen   from pron1 high estate 
o city trammelle in the toil of fate 
person1 nought remain of all pron1 glorious day 
but a dull shield a crown of withered bay 

yet pron1 beneath this night of war and fear 
from tranquil tower can watch the come year 
pron1 can foretell pron1 joy the day shall bring 
or why before the dawn the linnet sing 
thou even thou mayst wake as wake the rose 
to crimson splendour from pron1 grave of snow 
as the rich corn field rise to red and gold 
from these brown land now stiff with winter be cold 
as from the storm rack come a perfect star 

o much loved city   pron1 have wander far 
from the wave circle island of pron1 home 
have see the gloomy mystery of the dome 
rise slowly from the drear campagna be way 
clothe in the royal purple of the day 
pron1 from the city of the person1 person1 
have watch the sun by person1 be hill go down 
and mark the person1 laughter of the sea 
from starlit hill of flower star arcady 
yet back to person1 return pron1 perfect love 
as to pron1 forest nest the evening dove 

o poet be city   ordinal1 pron1 scarce have see 
some ordinal1 summer cast pron1 doublet green 
for autumn be livery would seek in vain 
to wake pron1 lyre to sing a loud strain 
or tell pron1 day of glory   poor indeed 
be the low murmur of the shepherd be reed 
where the loud person1 be blast should shake the sky 
and flame across the heaven   and to try 
such lofty theme be folly yet pron1 know 
that never feel pron1 heart a noble glow 
than when pron1 wake the silence of pron1 street 
with clamorous trampling of pron1 horse be foot 
and see the city which now pron1 try to sing 
after long day of weary travelling 

vii 

person1 person1   but a year ago 
pron1 stand and watch the crimson sunset glow 
from the lone chapel on pron1 marshy plain 
the sky be as a shield pron1 catch the stain 
of blood and battle from the die sun 
and in the west the circle cloud have spin 
a royal robe which some great person1 might wear 
while into ocean sea of purple air 
sank the gold galley of the person1 of light 

yet here the gentle stillness of the night 
bring back the swell tide of memory 
and wake again pron1 passionate love for pron1 
now be the spring of love yet soon will come 
on meadow and tree the summer be lordly bloom 
and soon the grass with bright flower will blow 
and send up lily for some boy to mow 
then before long the summer be person1 
rich autumn time the season be usurer 
will lend pron1 hoard gold to all the tree 
and see pron1 scatter by the spendthrift breeze 
and after that the winter cold and drear 
so run the perfect cycle of the year 
and so from youth to manhood do pron1 go 
and fall to weary day and lock of snow 
love only know no winter   never die 
nor care for frown storm or leaden sky 
and mine for pron1 shall never pass away 
though pron1 weak lip may falter in pron1 lay 

person1   person1   person1 silent evening star 
the night be ambassador person1 gleam afar 
and bid the shepherd bring pron1 flock to fold 
perchance before pron1 inland sea of gold 
be garner by the reaper into sheaf 
perchance before pron1 see the autumn leave 
pron1 may behold pron1 city   and lie down 
low at pron1 foot the poet be person1 person1 

person1   person1   person1 silver lamp the moon 
which turn pron1 midnight into perfect noon 
person1 surely light pron1 tower guard well 
where person1 sleep where person1 love to dwell
